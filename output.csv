A new law forbids media operating in Russia to use the words “war,” “attack” or “invasion” to describe Putin’s decision to unleash his forces against Ukraine. Instead, they are to use the Kremlin’s Orwellian phrase: “special military operation.”\n    \n\n    \n            Russians’ access to social media like Facebook and Twitter has also been severely restricted.\n    \n\n    \n            “Sanctions may cause ordinary Russians to ask why can’t they see their Russian athletes performing? And clearly, then there’s prompting the Russian people to say ‘What’s going on?’” Payne said.\u200b\n    \n\n    \n            “Will Putin care about having to give his Olympic gold order back or what the rest of the international world thinks of him?

He’s using oligarchs, politics, former athletes, to create a machine.\n    \n\n    \n            “It’s a big system, where people [are] driven by Putin in the directions that they need to create a beautiful picture of Russia, in the world of sports,” he added.\n    \n\n    \n            This worked for the most part, Aubin said.\n    \n\n    \n            “It worked because in 2014, we are seeing the Sochi Olympics. Then four years after, we are seeing the World Cup. It is really very hard to say how many international sporting events Russia [has] hosted the past 10 years – it’s really a lot. At the beginning, it was a huge element of soft power,” Aubin added.  \n    \n\n    \n            Vera Tolz, professor of Russian studies at the University of Manchester, told CNN Sport that Putin has used Russian nationalism “instrumentally and very systematically” as a way of legitimizing his regime since he came to power.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “Nationalism – and the kind of national unification with promoting particular versions of history, of organizing, establishing new national holidays, and of course, sport – has been absolutely key to his legitimation strategy,” she explained, adding such tactics date back to the Soviet period, where sport was used “very intensively as a tool of building loyalty of the people to the regime.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Even the fact that the Kremlin, Russia, has gone to such lengths, in using doping, in order to win more medals, in a way shows how participating in competitions and winning, winning was key to Putin’s Popular Mobilization strategy,” Tolz added. \n    \n\n    \n            In 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) unanimously agreed to ban Russia from major international sporting competitions – notably the Olympics and the World Cup – for four years over doping non-compliance. \n    \n\n    \n            The ban was later halved by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2020.\n    \n\n    \n            WADA’s punishment relates to inconsistencies in data retrieved by WADA in January 2019 from the Moscow lab at the center of the 2016 McLaren report, which uncovered a widespread and sophisticated state-sponsored sports doping network.\n    \n\n    \n            “Every time you let Russia into an international sporting event, you’re essentially agreeing to swim with man-eating sharks. They will cheat your athletes, they will not feel bad about it, they will lie about it, if they’re caught, they will blame you for calling it out,” Jim Walden, the US lawyer of Grigory Rodchenkov who was instrumental in exposing Russia’s initial cover-up, told CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            Ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, Putin spoke of his frustration of the “politicization of sport” and that the “the rights and interests of our athletes must be protected from any arbitrariness.”\n    \n\n    \n            The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was initially deemed non-compliant after the publication of the McLaren report in 2016.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Commissioned by WADA, the report found the Russian state conspired with athletes and sporting officials to undertake a doping program that was unprecedented in its scale and ambition.\n    \n\n    \n            “Putin very much uses his control over sport to try to game the world and win as much as possible, and also curates the content for the Russian population so that he can get maximum popularity, which translates into maximum power to do what he wants internationally – essentially pitting Russia against the rest of the world, at least the rest of the Western world,” Walden added.\n    \n\n    \n            Fast forward to 2022 and another doping scandal – surrounding Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva – overshadowed the Winter Olympics in Beijing.\n    \n\n    \n            The 15-year-old Valieva, a breakout star of the Games who got the highest mark in the figure skating team event, was allowed to compete despite testing positive for the banned heart drug trimetazidine, which is commonly used to treat people with angina. The failed test occurred before the Winter Olympics but only came to light during the Games, and it remains unclear if the drug test controversy will see the medal revoked.\n    \n\n    \n            “Not only is Russia myopically focused on winning at any cost, but in terms of any costs, it’s no holds barred, right? So murder, bribery, drug trafficking, any kind of criminality that will give them an advantage. They believe that not only will they do it, but that other people are weak for following the rules,” Walden said.\n    \n\n    \n            “So they marry criminality with obstruction and put that together with sports. And that is how they have consistently won. And that’s how the Russian government has used it to prop up its own popularity, so that it has more leeway to engage in troublemaking abroad,” he added.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Olympic great Edwin Moses, who opposed the 1980 US boycott of the Moscow Olympics, has gone so far as to call for Russia to be banned from the 2024 Olympics.\n    \n\n    \n            “The boycott in 1980 was political. This is just horrible,” Moses, who is Chairman of the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation, said in a press release from Laureus last week.\n    \n\n    \n            “It hasn’t got a lot to do with politics, it has to do with humanity, the war, the fighting, the children and innocent people getting killed, rockets and missiles, tanks … and it’s live on TV, so everyone is aware of it.\n    \n\n    \n            “I was in favor of banning the Russians because of what happened in Sochi in 2014 for really corrupting the integrity of the Olympic Games, via doping. I was on the executive committee of the World Anti-Doping Agency, and I thought the penalties were too light.\n    \n\n    \n            “What they’re doing to the entire world right now in Ukraine, is exactly the same thing they’ve done to sport, in my opinion. Russia ought to be banned in Paris [2024 Olympic Games].”\n    \n\n    \n            A few years ago, Moses says he met Putin.\n    \n\n    \n            “I once sat next to him at [a] table. Two seats to my left, and the translator was in between. And I spoke to him that entire evening. I know how he talked about sports, like it was the Holy Grail, and how important sport was, and how it was good where the best of everyone’s country, regardless of your philosophy can compete together, and whoever wins, wins…. I realize now, it was just propaganda.”\n    \n\n  \n  CNN’s Ben Morse and Ben Church contributed reporting.\n\n\n                ', 'length': 11561, 'description': 'As Russia continues its invasion of Ukraine, the grim reality of war has taken center stage, with more than two million Ukrainians fleeing the country and hundreds dead, according to the UN.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220304103946-20220304-sports-putin.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-10T09:50:57Z', 'keywords': ['athletes', ' continents and regions', ' drugs and society', ' drugs in sports', ' eastern europe', ' embargoes and sanctions', ' europe', ' international olympic committee', ' international relations', ' international relations and national security', ' misc organizations', ' olympics', ' political figures - intl', ' russia', ' russia-ukraine conflict', ' society', ' sports and recreation', ' sports events', ' sports organizations and teams', ' ukraine', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war', ' vladimir putin', ' world anti-doping agency', ' government and public administration', ' government bodies and offices', ' heads of government', ' heads of state', ' politics', ' football (soccer)'], 'summary': ['“Sanctions may cause ordinary Russians to ask why can’t they see their Russian athletes performing?', '“Today, President Putin uses sports as an element of his power.', 'And not only as a part of his personality because he also has created a big sporting system.', '“It worked because in 2014, we are seeing the Sochi Olympics.', 'Then four years after, we are seeing the World Cup.', 'At the beginning, it was a huge element of soft power,” Aubin added.', 'The ban was later halved by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in 2020.', 'Russia ought to be banned in Paris [2024 Olympic Games].”', 'A few years ago, Moses says he met Putin.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 19, 'comparative': 0.010900745840504877, 'calculation': [{'propaganda': -2}, {'wins': 4}, {'best': 3}, {'good': 3}, {'important': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'banned': -2}, {'integrity': 2}, {'corrupting': -3}, {'favor': 2}, {'killed': -3}, {'fighting': -2}, {'war': -2}, {'good': 3}, {'horrible': -3}, {'boycott': -2}, {'banned': -2}, {'boycott': -2}, {'great': 3}, {'engage': 1}, {'popularity': 3}, {'won': 3}, {'obstruction': -2}, {'weak': -2}, {'advantage': 2}, {'kind': 2}, {'murder': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'winning': 4}, {'focused': 2}, {'medal': 3}, {'controversy': -2}, {'unclear': -1}, {'failed': -2}, {'banned': -2}, {'positive': 2}, {'scandal': -3}, {'popularity': 3}, {'win': 4}, {'protected': 1}, {'interests': 1}, {'frustration': -2}, {'cover-up': -3}, {'exposing': -1}, {'blame': -2}, {'bad': -3}, {'cheat': -3}, {'sophisticated': 2}, {'ban': -2}, {'ban': -2}, {'agreed': 1}, {'popular': 3}, {'winning': 4}, {'winning': 4}, {'win': 4}, {'loyalty': 3}, {'promoting': 1}, {'kind': 2}, {'huge': 1}, {'hard': -1}, {'beautiful': 3}, {'big': 1}, {'big': 1}, {'invite': 1}, {'carefully': 2}, {'care': 2}, {'gold': 2}, {'care': 2}, {'clearly': 1}, {'restricted': -2}, {'severely': -2}, {'like': 2}, {'invasion': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'misunderstanding': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'champions': 2}, {'conflict': -2}, {'challenge': -1}, {'success': 2}, {'importance': 2}, {'passionate': 2}, {'suspended': -1}, {'banned': -2}, {'strongest': 2}, {'award': 3}, {'disgrace': -2}, {'ban': -2}, {'recommended': 2}, {'threatened': -2}, {'invasion': -1}, {'imposing': -1}, {'aggression': -2}, {'dead': -3}, {'war': -2}, {'grim': -2}, {'invasion': -1}], 'postive': ['wins', 'best', 'good', 'important', 'like', 'integrity', 'favor', 'good', 'great', 'engage', 'popularity', 'won', 'advantage', 'kind', 'winning', 'focused', 'medal', 'positive', 'popularity', 'win', 'protected', 'interests', 'sophisticated', 'agreed', 'popular', 'winning', 'winning', 'win', 'loyalty', 'promoting', 'kind', 'huge', 'beautiful', 'big', 'big', 'invite', 'carefully', 'care', 'gold', 'care', 'clearly', 'like', 'champions', 'success', 'importance', 'passionate', 'strongest', 'award', 'recommended'], 'negative': ['propaganda', 'banned', 'corrupting', 'killed', 'fighting', 'war', 'horrible', 'boycott', 'banned', 'boycott', 'obstruction', 'weak', 'murder', 'no', 'controversy', 'unclear', 'failed', 'banned', 'scandal', 'frustration', 'cover-up', 'exposing', 'blame', 'bad', 'cheat', 'ban', 'ban', 'hard', 'restricted', 'severely', 'invasion', 'no', 'misunderstanding', 'no', 'no', 'conflict', 'challenge', 'suspended', 'banned', 'disgrace', 'ban', 'threatened', 'invasion', 'imposing', 'aggression', 'dead', 'war', 'grim', 'invasion']}}"

He’s currently the campaign spokesman for Trevor Reed, who has been detained in Russia since August 2019.\n    \n\n    \n            Based on the limited information that has been provided by the Russian Federal Customs Service and state media, Franks is very concerned about the predicament that Griner now finds herself to be in.\n    \n\n    \n            “This has a lot of hallmarks of a very wrongful and arbitrary detention,” he explained. “I found the video from the Russian customs service odd. They’re parading her before cameras. The mugshot was completely unnecessary and asinine.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The Russian Customs Service claims that Griner was ‘smuggling significant amounts of narcotic substances’ and says that a criminal case is underway. A potential jail sentence of 10 years has been mentioned.\n    \n\n    \n            “They’re making her out to sound like a drug kingpin. I think that it is unlikely that Ms. Griner will get a fair trial,” concludes Franks, “because nobody gets a fair trial in Russia. It’s a rigged game.”  \n    \n\n    \n            In 2014, the American Iranian journalist Jason Rezaian was detained in Tehran. He couldn’t have known it at the time, but he was in for a long stay at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison: 544 days.\n    \n\n    \n            The Washington Post reporter was eventually released in January 2016, and in Griner’s case he sees many parallels to his own. “It’s the most audacious hostage taking by a state imaginable,” Rezaian told CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            “I know from my own case that the supposed charges against me were not based in anything like reality, and they were used to perpetuate a narrative about why I was being held.”\n    \n\n    \n            Like Franks, Rezaian cautions against repeating the allegations against Griner verbatim.\n    \n\n    \n            “I think that every time reporters repeat that narrative, we’re doing some of the dirty work of the hostage takers for them. My attitude is Brittney Griner is innocent of any crimes until the world sees otherwise,” adds Rezaian.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            It’s still not exactly clear when Griner was apprehended in Russia, but it was some time in February, as she was returning from the States to compete for UMMC Ekaterinburg in the Russian basketball league.\n    \n\n    \n            It’s Griner’s seventh season in Russia, where she plays during the off-season in North America. News of her predicament didn’t arrive in the US until March 5, when Russia revealed that they were holding her.\n    \n\n    \n            Only then did Griner’s wife, Cherelle, begin writing about it on Instagram. “There are no words to express this pain,” she said. “I’m hurting, we’re hurting.”\n    \n\n    \n            If she can indeed be classified as a ‘hostage,’ Griner will join an unenviable club of around more than 50 American citizens who are currently held hostage or wrongfully detained overseas.\n    \n\n    \n            Campaigners have been working to free Americans Reed and Paul Whelan, who are both in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            Whilst acknowledging that Griner’s family have been placed under an enormous amount of emotional stress, Rezaian believes they should have spoken up sooner. \n    \n\n    \n            “They made the same mistake that I see others making time and again, allowing the possible hostage taker to take control of the narrative,” says Rezaian.\n    \n\n    \n            “Unfortunately, we see people telling themselves: ‘This is all just a big mistake that’s going to blow over in a few days.’ Suppressing her detention isn’t doing her any favors, these things don’t magically resolve themselves.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The timing of Griner’s detention could hardly be worse, she was arrested in the lead-up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and it was publicized only after the US had begun sanctioning the Russian government.\n    \n\n    \n            “You can’t extricate these things from each other,” Rezaian explained. “To try and maintain diplomatic niceties around these situations may be in the interest of US national security, but it’s certainly not in the interest of Brittney Griner.”\n    \n\n    \n            Rezaian urges Griner’s family to speak up and encourages her American employers to make some noise.\n    \n\n    \n            Griner is a two-time Olympic champion, a seven-time all-star with the Phoenix Mercury and a legend of the women’s professional league, the WNBA. Whilst her team and the league have issued brief statements, Rezaian says they could and should be doing so much more.\n    \n\n    \n            “The WNBA, a part of the NBA, one of the biggest and most powerful sports leagues in the whole world, has a real responsibility to this individual,” he says. “There should be a robust response.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            In the vacuum of information about Griner’s situation, some have sought to fill the airwaves with commentary about her involvement with Russian basketball and the wisdom of her decision to travel there at a time when geo-political tensions in the region resembled a powder keg.\n    \n\n    \n            It’s a sentiment that smacks of victim-blaming. “It’s irrelevant,” says Rezaian. “It’s not a credible argument.”\n    \n\n    \n            Franks is equally dismissive. “Would have, could have, should have. It’s Monday morning quarterbacking, and it’s not helpful,” he says. “They have welcomed her to that country to work. To me, that’s pretty brazen.”\n    \n\n    \n            Both men say that Griner had every right to continue working as a professional athlete in Russia, and the fact that a country in which she was well known and celebrated has now locked her up only makes the allegations against her more suspicious.\n    \n\n    \n            Rezaian recalls the countless trips he made in and out of Iran over a period of five years. “I never had any problems until I did,| he says. “Is that my fault? No, absolutely not.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            It’s hard for anybody to predict what the coming weeks and months will bring in Griner’s case, but Rezaian draws on his own experience to suggest that Griner might have to prepare for a long stay in Russia. \n    \n\n    \n            “It may turn out to be a marathon, not a sprint. You hope that it’s a sprint but conserve your energy in a way that that will benefit you throughout this ordeal,” he says.\n    \n\n    \n            In a podcast called ’544 Days,’ that he released in October 2021, Rezaian details the anxiety, uncertainty, and monotony of his detention in Iran. He says he made the audio series partly to lay out a roadmap to the families of other citizens that may one day find themselves in a similar situation.\n    \n\n    \n            “I tried to find things to laugh at every day because there’s certainly a lot of absurdity in these situations,” he adds.\n    \n\n    \n            “That doesn’t take away from the horror and the terror of it, but the absurdity that a great American athlete is being held on unsubstantiated charges at the dawn of a cataclysmic war on the other side of the world? It is horrifying, but it’s also farcical in its own way.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Franks knows from his time of advocating for Reed that Griner could be detained for a while. \n    \n\n    \n            He urges everybody that cares about her to keep her case in the public arena.\n    \n\n    \n            “Sports fans can play a huge role because they’re not a constituency that I think the [American] government is hearing from,” says Franks.\n    \n\n    \n            “You want to see Brittney Griner come home? Or Trevor Reed or Paul Whelan or any of the other 50 hostages? I would suggest calling the White House every day and telling them you want President Biden to prioritize the repatriation of wrongfully detained American citizens.”\n    \n\n    \n            Franks reiterates that Griner’s family should do the same. “There’s a difficult choice to make about whether to speak or not to but shine a light,” he says. “If it were my loved one, my answer would be shine a light. Every time.\n    \n\n    \n            “People that do wrongful detention are oddly sensitive to bad headlines.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 9146, 'description': 'When Jonathan Franks first heard that the American basketball star Brittney Griner had been detained in Russia, his initial sense was one of disbelief.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220310103000-01-brittney-griner-file-083121.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-14T08:52:17Z', 'keywords': ['brittney griner', ' continents and regions', ' crime', ' law enforcement and corrections', ' crimes against persons', ' criminal offenses', ' eastern europe', ' europe', ' hostage taking', ' jason rezaian', ' misc people', ' russia', ' sports figures', ' basketball', ' sports and recreation', ' sports organizations and teams', ' wnba'], 'summary': ['In 2014, the American Iranian journalist Jason Rezaian was detained in Tehran.', '“It’s the most audacious hostage taking by a state imaginable,” Rezaian told CNN.', 'It’s Griner’s seventh season in Russia, where she plays during the off-season in North America.', '“You can’t extricate these things from each other,” Rezaian explained.', '“It’s irrelevant,” says Rezaian.', 'Rezaian recalls the countless trips he made in and out of Iran over a period of five years.', 'Franks knows from his time of advocating for Reed that Griner could be detained for a while.', '“You want to see Brittney Griner come home?', 'Franks reiterates that Griner’s family should do the same.'], 'sentiment': {'score': -52, 'comparative': -0.03732950466618808, 'calculation': [{'bad': -3}, {'detention': -2}, {'wrongful': -2}, {'loved': 3}, {'difficult': -1}, {'detained': -2}, {'wrongfully': -2}, {'want': 1}, {'want': 1}, {'huge': 1}, {'cares': 2}, {'detained': -2}, {'war': -2}, {'charges': -2}, {'great': 3}, {'terror': -3}, {'laugh': 1}, {'detention': -2}, {'anxiety': -2}, {'benefit': 2}, {'hope': 2}, {'hard': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'problems': -2}, {'suspicious': -2}, {'allegations': -2}, {'celebrated': 3}, {'pretty': 1}, {'welcomed': 2}, {'helpful': -2}, {'wisdom': 1}, {'robust': 2}, {'responsibility': 1}, {'powerful': 2}, {'champion': 2}, {'encourages': 2}, {'interest': 1}, {'interest': 1}, {'invasion': -1}, {'arrested': -3}, {'worse': -3}, {'detention': -2}, {'resolve': 2}, {'favors': 2}, {'detention': -2}, {'mistake': -2}, {'big': 1}, {'mistake': -2}, {'stress': -1}, {'free': 1}, {'detained': -2}, {'wrongfully': -2}, {'join': 1}, {'hurting': -2}, {'hurting': -2}, {'pain': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'clear': 1}, {'crimes': -3}, {'dirty': -2}, {'allegations': -2}, {'like': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'charges': -2}, {'audacious': 3}, {'prison': -2}, {'notorious': -2}, {'detained': -2}, {'rigged': -1}, {'fair': 2}, {'fair': 2}, {'unlikely': -1}, {'like': 2}, {'sentence': -2}, {'criminal': -3}, {'significant': 1}, {'odd': -2}, {'detention': -2}, {'wrongful': -2}, {'concerned': -2}, {'limited': -1}, {'detained': -2}, {'hostile': -2}, {'suspicious': -2}, {'true': 2}, {'true': 2}, {'allegations': -2}, {'mistake': -2}, {'huge': 1}, {'allegations': -2}, {'crime': -3}, {'accused': -2}, {'arrested': -3}, {'kind': 2}, {'detained': -2}], 'postive': ['loved', 'want', 'want', 'huge', 'cares', 'great', 'laugh', 'benefit', 'hope', 'celebrated', 'pretty', 'welcomed', 'wisdom', 'robust', 'responsibility', 'powerful', 'champion', 'encourages', 'interest', 'interest', 'resolve', 'favors', 'big', 'free', 'join', 'clear', 'like', 'like', 'audacious', 'fair', 'fair', 'like', 'significant', 'true', 'true', 'huge', 'kind'], 'negative': ['bad', 'detention', 'wrongful', 'difficult', 'detained', 'wrongfully', 'detained', 'war', 'charges', 'terror', 'detention', 'anxiety', 'hard', 'no', 'problems', 'suspicious', 'allegations', 'helpful', 'invasion', 'arrested', 'worse', 'detention', 'detention', 'mistake', 'mistake', 'stress', 'detained', 'wrongfully', 'hurting', 'hurting', 'pain', 'no', 'crimes', 'dirty', 'allegations', 'charges', 'prison', 'notorious', 'detained', 'rigged', 'unlikely', 'sentence', 'criminal', 'odd', 'detention', 'wrongful', 'concerned', 'limited', 'detained', 'hostile', 'suspicious', 'allegations', 'mistake', 'allegations', 'crime', 'accused', 'arrested', 'detained']}}"

The lockdowns in China, which has a zero-tolerance Covid policy, raised fears in the energy market about slower demand from the world’s No. 2 economy.\n    \n\n    \n            “Coronavirus has taught us you cannot count on a stable outcome,” said Kloza. “Just when you think people are going back to normal behavior, here it comes.”\n    \n\n    \n            Oil traders are also watching for developments in the war in Ukraine, including continued negotiations between Ukraine and Russia. A ceasefire could ease fears about a prolonged disruption in oil flows from Russia, the No. 2 oil producer in the world last year. \n    \n\n    \n            However, energy veterans cautioned against reading too much into the headlines around negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            “I am super skeptical about any kind of negotiations having success here, period,” said Robert Yawger, vice president of energy futures at Mizuho Securities. \n    \n\n    \n            Yawger said even if a ceasefire were to emerge, the West is very unlikely to swiftly remove sanctions on Russia: “Sanctions are not going to disappear anytime soon.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 4212, 'description': 'US oil prices briefly tumbled below $100 a barrel on Monday, unwinding a significant chunk of the recent spike caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220314110922-us-oil-field-0313.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-14T15:20:43Z', 'keywords': ['banking', ' finance and investments', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' commodity markets', ' energy and utilities', ' energy commodities', ' financial markets and investing', ' oil and gas industry', ' oil prices', ' continents and regions', ' eastern europe', ' economic indicators', ' economy and economic indicators', ' energy and resources', ' energy economic indicators', ' europe', ' gas stations', ' russia', ' ukraine', ' russia-ukraine conflict', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war'], 'summary': ['Oil plunged more than 8%, touching a low of $99.76 a barrel.', '“You’re seeing some vicious selling,” said Matt Smith, lead oil analyst of the Americas at Kpler.', 'Despite the recent selling, oil remains up by more than 30% on the year.', 'Still, the tumble back to $100 should cool off prices at the pump, which move with a lag to oil.', 'That would mean gas prices are still high — and above $4 a gallon nationally — but below record highs.', 'Gas prices have already stopped going straight up, even before Monday’s sharp decline in oil.', '“Given how big and important Russia is, we will probably breach those all-time highs set in 2008.”'], 'sentiment': {'score': -13, 'comparative': -0.02090032154340836, 'calculation': [{'disappear': -1}, {'swiftly': 2}, {'unlikely': -1}, {'success': 2}, {'kind': 2}, {'skeptical': -2}, {'super': 3}, {'no': -1}, {'disruption': -2}, {'ease': 2}, {'war': -2}, {'stable': 2}, {'no': -1}, {'demand': -1}, {'outbreak': -2}, {'worst': -3}, {'breach': -2}, {'important': 2}, {'big': 1}, {'demand': -1}, {'rise': 1}, {'straight': 1}, {'stopped': -1}, {'lag': -1}, {'cool': 1}, {'vicious': -2}, {'progress': 2}, {'hopes': 2}, {'losses': -3}, {'blamed': -2}, {'dropped': -1}, {'crude': -1}, {'united': 1}, {'recession': -2}, {'ease': 2}, {'hell': -4}, {'lost': -3}, {'invasion': -1}, {'significant': 1}], 'postive': ['swiftly', 'success', 'kind', 'super', 'ease', 'stable', 'important', 'big', 'rise', 'straight', 'cool', 'progress', 'hopes', 'united', 'ease', 'significant'], 'negative': ['disappear', 'unlikely', 'skeptical', 'no', 'disruption', 'war', 'no', 'demand', 'outbreak', 'worst', 'breach', 'demand', 'stopped', 'lag', 'vicious', 'losses', 'blamed', 'dropped', 'crude', 'recession', 'hell', 'lost', 'invasion']}}"

They grew up dreaming of fighting their way to fame and glory, and together they conquered the world with their fists.\n    \n\n    \n            Between them, the 35-year-old Usyk and the 34-year-old Lomachenko won three Olympic gold medals and have since established themselves among the elite boxers in the world. \n    \n\n    \n            But now they are facing a very different fight – an existential one – for the very future of their country. Since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24, Usyk and Lomachenko have traveled into Ukraine, taken up arms and joined the territorial defense battalion.\n    \n\n    \n            Speaking via a video link from a basement in Kyiv, Usyk exclusively told CNN that it’s not just invading forces he needs to look out for, but looters as well. He says that he’s prepared to take a life, if necessary.\n    \n\n    \n            “If they will want to take my life, or the lives of my close ones, I will have to do it,” he said. “But I don’t want that. I don’t want to shoot, I don’t want to kill anybody, but if they will be killing me, I will have no choice.”\n    \n\n    \n            Usyk’s manager, Egis Klimas, helped coordinate the interview and translated for Usyk, who doesn’t speak English. Despite the terrifying situation that many Ukrainians now find themselves in, Usyk says that he isn’t afraid.\n    \n\n    \n            “Maybe, it’ll sound sentimental,” he explained, “but my soul belongs to the Lord and my body and my honor belong to my country, to my family. So there is no fear, absolutely no fear. There’s just bafflement – how could this be in the 21st century?”\n    \n\n    \n            He’s not in Ukraine to box right now, but the noble art is still useful in this moment. “It has helped me to be calm and mentally prepared,” he said, “And it helps me to help others who are panicking and nervous.” \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Both men were outside of the country when Russia invaded; Usyk had been in London, shooting sequences for an upcoming video game.\n    \n\n    \n            He was intending to fly home just hours after the hostilities had commenced, but with the airports closed, he instead flew to Warsaw in Poland and drove almost 500 miles back home and over the border to Kyiv.\n    \n\n    \n            Lomachenko had been visiting a monastery in Greece and returned home the next day. Instead of flying directly to his hometown of Odessa, he traveled to Bucharest in Romania, then drove for nine hours to the port and caught a ferry into Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            Their manager told CNN that he didn’t know they were thinking of taking up arms until they had already signed up for the defense battalion. Former world boxing champions, Vitali – who is also the Mayor of Kyiv – and Wladimir Klitschko, have also taken up arms in defense of their nation.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Lomachenko was scheduled to speak with CNN at the same time as Usyk but wasn’t responding to the calls from his manager at the time. Early Wednesday morning local time, Klimas confirmed to CNN that Lomachenko was safe and sound.\n    \n\n    \n            He and Usyk remain close: they are godfathers to each other’s children and celebrate family birthdays together. Six days into the war, Usyk knows that nowhere is safe anymore in Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            “The bombing around is crazy,” Usyk said. “They just bombed the city of Mariupol, one of my friends got a rocket in his roof. [The Russians] are not playing games.” \n    \n\n    \n            As the fighting rages, so too does the debate about whether Russian athletes should be sanctioned for the actions of their country. Usyk chose not to weigh in directly, suggesting that there are innocent people on both sides of the conflict.\n    \n\n    \n            “Russian people don’t really know exactly what’s going on here. They’re not seeing what’s going on. They are victims of their President [Vladimir Putin].”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Usyk has only just become the IBF, WBA, WBO and IBO world heavyweight champion. In September, he defeated Anthony Joshua in London in a superb boxing display to claim the belts. His manager says that talks of a rematch this summer are at an advanced stage.\n    \n\n    \n            The lightweight Lomachenko has previously been world champion in three different weight classes and was planning to fight George Kambosos in Australia in June.\n    \n\n    \n            But understandably, boxing is the last thing on their minds.\n    \n\n    \n            “I really don’t know when I’m going to be stepping back in the ring,” said Usyk, who looked exhausted and emotional in his interview with CNN. “My country and my honor are more important to me than a championship belt.”\n    \n\n    \n            Usyk has three children and, during the interview, the sound of young voices could be heard playing behind him in the basement. \n    \n\n    \n            He says that family, friends and neighbors have been sheltering together. “When there is an air raid alarm, we hide.

With less of those two essential agricultural ingredients, he expects knock-on effects for global food supplies. \n    \n\n    \n            “It’s not whether we are going to have a food crisis. It’s how large that crisis will be,” Holsether told CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            Two weeks after Russia invaded Ukraine, the prices of key agricultural products produced in the region have skyrocketed. The biggest problem is wheat, a pantry staple. Supplies from Russia and Ukraine, which together account for almost 30% of global wheat trade, are now at risk. Global wheat prices hit an all-time high earlier this week.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Another major problem is access to fertilizer. Essential for farmers to hit their production targets for crops, it’s never been more expensive, as exports from Russia grind to a halt. Output in Europe has also plunged thanks to the surging price of natural gas, a key ingredient in nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea.\n    \n\n    \n            The situation is ringing alarm bells for global health experts. The cost of corn, soybeans and vegetable oils has been jumping, too.\n    \n\n    \n            Agriculture ministers from the G7 countries said Friday they “remain determined to do what is necessary to prevent and respond to a food crisis.”\n    \n\n    \n            But fearing shortages, countries are already turning inward, which could ultimately leave less food for those in need. \n    \n\n    \n            Egypt just banned the export of wheat, flour, lentils and beans amid growing concerns over food reserves in the Arab world’s most populous state. Indonesia has also tightened export restrictions on palm oil, which is a component in cooking oil as well as in cosmetics and some packaged goods like chocolate. It’s the world’s top producer of the product. \n    \n\n    \n            The G7 ministers called on countries to “keep their food and agricultural markets open and to guard against any unjustified restrictive measures on their exports.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Any further increase in food price levels and volatility in international markets could threaten food security and nutrition at a global scale, especially among the most vulnerable living in environments of low food security,” they said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            Western countries with more access to agriculture will be hurt, too. Consumers there have already been stung by higher prices, and the situation is poised to deteriorate further.\n    \n\n  \n    Russia, Ukraine and global food supplies\n\n\n    \n            Even before Russia launched a war in Ukraine, the global food system was strained. Snarled supply chains and unpredictable weather patterns — often the result of climate change — had already pushed food prices to their highest level in about a decade. Affordability was also an issue after the pandemic left millions out of work.\n    \n\n    \n            The number of people on the edge of famine has jumped to 44 million from 27 million in 2019, the UN’s World Food Programme said this month.\n    \n\n    \n            The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which both play crucial roles in the carefully calibrated system of global food production, stands to make the situation worse.\n    \n\n    \n            Global wheat prices have fallen from record highs in recent days, but remain elevated. They’re expected to stay that way for some time, according to Rabobank commodity analyst Carlos Mera.\n    \n\n    \n            The wheat planting season, which is about to begin in Ukraine, will be disrupted by fighting. It’s not clear there will be enough farmers to till the land, as people in the country take up arms — or whether they’ll be able to access machinery and other essential products that would typically arrive through Black Sea ports.\n    \n\n    \n            “It’s anyone’s guess if Ukraine will be able to export anything for the rest of this year, or next year, or in the foreseeable future,” Mera said. The country also accounts for half of all exports of sunflower oil.\n    \n\n    \n            Getting products from Russia onto the world market has also gotten more difficult, because businesses don’t want to risk running afoul of sanctions or deal with the logistics of traveling near a war zone.\n    \n\n    \n            Russia and Ukraine serve as the breadbasket for countries in the Middle East and North Africa that depend on imports. Many will be hit hard as a result. The United States and Europe will feel the pain, too, since the run-up in prices for important agricultural goods will affect businesses that produce food in every market.\n    \n\n    \n            “Any serious disruption of production and exports from these suppliers will no doubt drive up prices further and erode food security for millions of people,” the Agricultural Market Information System said in a recent report.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The brewing crisis goes beyond wheat and oils.

Among them is San Diego-based TuSimple.\n    \n\n    \n            Founded in 2015, TuSimple has completed about 2 million miles of road tests with its 70 prototype trucks across the US, China and Europe. Although these are simply commercially available trucks retrofitted with its technology, TuSimple has deals in place with two of the world’s largest truck manufacturers – Navistar in the US and Traton, Volkswagen’s trucking business, in Europe – to design and build fully autonomous models, which it hopes to launch by 2024.\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n            TuSimple’s latest road test involved hauling fresh produce 951 miles, from Nogales, Arizona to Oklahoma City. The pickup and the dropoff were handled by a human driver, but for the bulk of the route – from Tucson to Dallas – the truck drove itself. \n    \n\n    \n            “Today, because the system is not fully ready, we have a safety driver and a safety engineer on board at all times when we’re testing, but we drove in full autonomy: the driver wasn’t touching the wheel,” said Cheng Lu, TuSimple’s president and CEO. \n    \n\n\n    \n            The journey was completed in 14 hours versus the usual 24 with a human driver, mostly because a truck doesn’t need to sleep. “In the US, a driver can only work 11 hours a day. We simply had a handoff when our first pair of drivers had to stop because they reached their 11 hours of operation,” said Lu. That, of course, negates the advantage of an autonomous system, so the idea is that once TuSimple’s trucks hit the market, there will be no need to have anyone onboard. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            Unlike self-driving cars, which are a still a way from being commercially available, TuSimple trucks won’t be required to operate in bustling city traffic, but only on stretches of highway that have been thoroughly mapped via the company’s own software.\n    \n\n\n    \n            “We collect data from the roads, and we create this very detailed, high definition map of each route. That adds another layer of safety for the vehicles,” said Lu. As a result, TuSimple’s trucks will only be able to self-drive along these pre-mapped trade corridors, which Lu calls “virtual railroads,” and nowhere else. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            According to the company, in the US 80% of goods travel through just 10% of the nation’s trade corridors, so even selective mapping allows for capturing a large portion of the business. TuSimple is currently mapping routes between Arizona and Texas, and plans to have mapped routes across the nation by 2024. \n    \n\n    \n            Its plans are dependent on state legislation, however, because currently some states do not allow for testing of autonomous trucks on public roads.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The technology will add about $50,000 to the cost of a truck, making the final price roughly $200,000. According to Lu, that’s still cheaper than paying for a human driver. \n    \n\n    \n            “If you take $50,000 and divide it by 1 million miles, the average lifespan of a truck, that means you’re adding five cents per mile. But you’re saving the cost of a human driver, which based on average US wages is about $80,000 to $120,000 per year – or 80 cents to $1.20 per mile. Today, the direct labor cost is about 50% of the cost of operating a truck,” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            Read: A robotic ‘Ironhand’ could protect factory workers from injuries\n    \n\n    \n            That doesn’t mean driverless trucks will take away jobs, according to Lu. By focusing on the “middle mile,” rather than on the pickup and delivery of the goods, TuSimple believes it can create new freight capacity without creating new demand for drivers, while at the same time protecting existing jobs. “A UPS driver is dropping off 200 packages a day – that’s not what autonomy is meant for. We believe that every driver will be able to retire as a driver, even if they enter the workforce today,” said Lu. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            Instead, TuSimple aims to take over the routes between terminals and distribution centers, which involve long stretches of monotonous driving. \n    \n\n    \n            “Take Phoenix to El Paso: that’s a six-hour drive. A person cannot make the round trip, because it’s more than 11 hours. But the truck can go back and forth all day, the most mundane job that drivers don’t want to do. That means you free up that human driver to do the first and the last mile (pickup and delivery).They get to work a full day, which is a more efficient use of their time, and they get to go home at night to their family,” said Lu.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Although Lu says that the reliability of both the software and the hardware still needs to be increased, TuSimple is planning its first fully autonomous tests, without a human safety driver in the cabin at all, before the end of the year. The results of such tests will indicate whether the company can meet its goal to launch its own trucks by 2024. Lu says that 7,000 have been reserved in the US alone.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            TuSimple has prominent competitors, such as Google spinoff Waymo and Uber-backed Aurora, but those are working on a wider range of self-driving vehicles, including passenger cars. TuSimple is working exclusively on driverless trucks, like US companies Plus and Embark.\n    \n\n\n    \n            Grayson Brulte, an autonomy expert at consulting firm Brulte & Co., believes TuSimple is on the right track. “The biggest competitive advantage that TuSimple has over its competitors is that their technology was purpose-built for trucking.

He checked his phone and saw five missed calls from his parents as the invasion became a reality.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “That’s when I start panicking,” said Djau Codjovi, who was born in Spain to parents from the Ivory Coast and Guinea-Bissau.\n    \n\n    \n            “I was like ‘oh my days.’ I opened my suitcase and put everything inside,” he said.\n    \n\n    \n            “And then I went outside to see what’s going on and all my teammates were saying they invaded Ukraine, it is actually happening.”\n    \n\n    \n            Earlier in February during a training camp in Turkey, Djau Codjovi said his parents, Amadeo and Sika Marie, as well as agent Soriebah Kajue, had pleaded with him not to go back to Ukraine with the drums of war beating louder.\n    \n\n    \n            Djau Codjovi says Vorskla played down the threat or war – describing them as Russian “propaganda” – and assured the players that they had backup plans should they need to evacuate them at short notice. At the time, much of the world wasn’t sure of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s intentions, even as he massed troops at the border.\n    \n\n    \n            As a young player with hopes of breaking into the first team ahead of the Ukrainian Premier League’s resumption on February 25, Djau Codjovi opted to return in pursuit of his soccer dream.\n    \n\n    \n            That dream quickly turned into a nightmare.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            READ: Ukraine and Benfica star tears up after receiving standing ovation\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            When the Russians started attacking Kharkiv, which is 160 kilometers away from Vorskla, Djau Codjovi says he was told by his coach Iurii Maksymov that he should wait at the club’s accommodation while the player’s travel plans were being arranged.\n    \n\n    \n            But Djau Codjovi soon realized that he was on his own after he said some of his teammates, who were already plotting their way out, told him it was a case of “everyone for themselves.”\n    \n\n    \n            CNN has contacted Vorskla and Maksymov for comment on Djau Codjovi’s version of events but did not get a response at the time of publishing.\n    \n\n    \n            Loaded with water, chips and chocolate for the 1,500 kilometer journey, a group of 10 players and their families, including a toddler, hit the road unsure of what would await them.\n    \n\n    \n            After initially deciding to drive to the Polish border, they were informed of long lines of traffic and waiting times, so the traveling party headed towards the Hungarian border.\n    \n\n    \n            Petrol was scarce, the roads were full of potholes, and travel at night was challenging as explosions and gunfire could be heard.\n    \n\n    \n            Then disaster struck when one of the cars had a flat tire.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    Ukrainian tennis star Elina Svitolina speaks out against Russian invasion\n                \n                    \n                                03:21\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n    \n            “We had to stop,” Djau Codjovi said. “And then you could see the big tanks going past and I was scared, because I thought it was Russian troops.”\n    \n\n    \n            “It was like 5 a.m. and nobody was going to stop and help.”\n    \n\n    \n            In fact the tanks rolling by were the Ukrainian army, according to Djau Codjovi, but that did little to reassure him as he was concerned that Russian troops could open fire on them and his party would be caught in the crossfire.\n    \n\n    \n            After a delay of several hours and finally organizing a spare wheel, they were back on the road, before a short pitstop to sleep and get their energy back.\n    \n\n    \n            On day two of their journey, they boarded a minivan, optimistically heading to the Hungarian border where they would be dropped off.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            “After driving 10 hours to the border, we get there.

Ivanov, reportedly one of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s closest allies.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            The Treasury Department said sanctions against Alrosa will heavily restrict the company’s ability to raise money through the US market – a key source of capital and revenue generation – limiting the Russian government’s ability to fund the further invasion of Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            Although the first wave of sanctions didn’t outright ban companies from buying diamonds from Russia, they complicated businesses’ ability to pay for them since many of Russia’s banks have been expelled from the international banking system SWIFT, said Zimnisky.\n    \n\n    \n            “(The sanctions) would draw out the delivery of rough diamonds by weeks, potentially months, to manufacturers who cut and polish the diamonds,” he said. For example, India – which accounts for 90% of all diamond cutting and polishing in the world – would immediately feel the impact. \n    \n\n    \n            The delays of up to three to six months will then make their way to retailers who buy the polished diamonds, he said.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The ban now means US businesses can’t buy Russian diamonds at all and will have to source Canadian, African, Brazilian or Australian diamonds, said Zimnisky.\n    \n\n    \n            Another hurdle he anticipates layered on top of the hard-hitting government sanctions are “self sanctions,” stemming from the moral and ethical stance that consumers themselves may adopt. “For many retailers, up to a third of their existing diamond inventory is of Russian origin,” he said.\n    \n\n    \n            Fine jewelry seller Brilliant Earth tweeted last month that it had removed all Russian mined diamonds from its website and that it hoped for a “peaceful and swift resolution in Ukraine.” \n    \n\n    \n            Signet Jewelers, one of the largest sellers of diamond jewelry in the world, said it suspended business interaction with Russian-owned entities at the beginning of the invasion, “in unity with all those in the world calling for peace.”\n    \n\n    \n            Signet\n            \n                (SIG) operates jewelry chains Zales, Jared, Kay Jewelers and Diamonds Direct under its corporate umbrella.\n    \n\n    \n            Alrosa last week suspended its own membership in the Natural Diamond Council, a diamond industry group that promotes and markets the use of natural diamonds. Its members include leading diamond producers De Beers and Dominion Diamond Mines. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The threat of disruptions to the diamond supply chain comes as the industry is already experiencing record global demand for diamonds and supply is at a decade-low level.\n    \n\n    \n            “Demand has been so robust over the past two years that there is essentially no excess inventory of diamonds right now,” said Zimnisky.\n    \n\n    \n            Jewelry purchases, and diamond jewelry, in particular, saw a boost through the pandemic, spurred by stimulus check spending and a build up of savings as Covid restrictions prevented other types of discretionary activities, such as travel and dining out.\n    \n\n    \n            Retail sales of diamond jewelry jumped 29% last year versus 2020 and were up 11% over 2019, according to a new report from consulting firm Bain & Company. Bain expects demand for diamond jewelry and polished and rough diamonds to continue to grow through the first half of this year. \n    \n\n    \n            “In 2022 the market is expected to demonstrate growth higher than the pre-pandemic period and return to historic growth pace by 2023-24,” the report said.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Zimnisky anticipates that the weight of geopolitical tension will affect diamond prices. “The time to watch is midyear, when businesses start to stock up on diamonds in preparation of holiday demand. I think that’s when the shortages will be felt most,” he said.\n    \n\n    \n            Martin Rapaport, founder of diamond industry research publication Rapaport Diamond Report and chair of the Rapaport Group which provides services to the diamond industry, sees the situation somewhat differently.\n    \n\n    \n            “Shortages of wheat, oil and other essentials and their impact on inflation will have a greater effect on diamond prices than any shortages of diamonds,” he said. \n    \n\n                ', 'length': 7164, 'description': 'Far-reaching global sanctions against Russia for its invasion of Ukraine are affecting the global supply of a precious commodity –  the diamonds used in jewelry.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220310193207-01-alrosa-diamond-sanction-file-2019.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-12T16:55:38Z', 'keywords': ['continents and regions', ' eastern europe', ' europe', ' russia', ' embargoes and sanctions', ' international relations', ' international relations and national security', ' russia-ukraine conflict', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war', ' north america', ' the americas', ' united states', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' clothing and accessories', ' consumer products', ' jewelry', ' luxury goods', ' diamond mining', ' mining and minerals', ' ukraine'], 'summary': ['In 2021, Alrosa supplied 32.4 million carats of diamonds.', 'Alrosa is partly owned by the Russian government and its shares trade on the Moscow Stock Exchange.', 'A raw diamond can touch many countries as it goes from an uncut gem to a beguiling necklace or ring.', '“The issue is ‘what is considered of Russian origin?’” Stevens said.', '“It can originate in Russia and is then cut and polished in India.', 'Included on the list is Alrosa and, separately, its CEO, Sergei S.

But once she was there, she said she was turned away, with staffers explaining there was no room. They advised her to go home and quarantine.\n    \n\n    \n            The problem? Her place of work was her home and “my employer didn’t want me to come back,” said Maria, noting that they had “kids in the house.” \n    \n\n    \n            “I said, ‘I don’t know where I can go. We don’t have a place,’” she told CNN Business, breaking into tears. She asked not to publish her real name, for fear of reprisals from current or future employers, and to not worry her family abroad. CNN Business agreed to call her “Maria.” \n    \n\n    \n            Foreign domestic workers are required to live with their employers in Hong Kong, under a longstanding government mandate that has been contested for years.\n    \n\n    \n            Maria, who is from the Philippines, returned to the hospital, where she spent the night sleeping on a chair in the emergency room, along with a friend in a similar situation. But the next day, they were told by a nurse more expressly to “go away,” she said.\n    \n\n    \n            Not knowing what else to do, they set up camp on the street. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “We cannot express what [we] feel [at] that time — just crying only,” said Maria.\n    \n\n    \n            Maria and her friend eventually found a shelter to stay in, run by the charity HELP for Domestic Workers. \n    \n\n    \n            Maria is one of dozens of migrant domestic workers who have been abandoned — and temporarily made homeless — in Hong Kong after testing positive for the coronavirus, according to the charity.  Her story, and others like it, shine a light on deep-seated inequalities in the city that are worsening under a devastating fifth wave of Covid-19. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            To be sure, workers across the spectrum are struggling in Hong Kong, given its rigid pandemic measures.\n    \n\n    \n            But as top companies give their employees more flexibility and even help pay for expensive hotel quarantines, local businesses are teetering on the brink of collapse. And while some expatriates can command higher salaries for simply agreeing to move to the city, the city’s poorest are struggling just to afford food or basic necessities.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The widening gap comes at a time when Hong Kong is facing an exodus of expats, despite the additional benefits on offer, which continues to raise questions about its future as a global business hub.\n    \n\n    \n            Many foreigners have had enough of the city’s unwavering commitment to its “zero Covid” policy, even as cases surge to record highs and cause more fatalities, overloading the health care system and delivering a huge punch to the economy. \n    \n\n    \n            Throughout 2020 and 2021, more residents left Hong Kong than came in, according to official population statistics. That marked a reversal from early 2019, when the population was going up. \n    \n\n    \n            Last month alone, more than 94,000 people departed the city, while only about 23,000 came in, immigration data showed.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “The recent wave of emigration is leading to a shortage of skilled workers and impacting businesses of all sizes,” the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said in a statement earlier this month.\n    \n\n    \n            The group’s chairman, Peter Wong, said the city was “facing an exodus of educated workers on a scale not seen since the early 1990s.”\n    \n\n    \n            “This will have a material knock-on impact on the economy,” he added. “There is real cause for concern if we cannot stem the current brain drain.”\n    \n\n    \n            The city has been largely sealed off from the rest of the world for the last two years, in part because most inbound travelers must quarantine in hotel rooms at their own expense for two weeks. Previously, the requirement was for three weeks. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            The issue has increasingly forced companies to rethink where their employees should be based, if only for now. \n    \n\n    \n            Last month, Mandarin Oriental\n            \n                (MAORF) CEO James Riley told the Financial Times that the former British colony had become a “very, very poor” base due to the restrictions.\n    \n\n    \n            According to the newspaper, the hotel group recently advocated for senior executives to temporarily live abroad, away from its Hong Kong headquarters. Mandarin Oriental declined to comment to CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            Last year, Cathay Pacific\n            \n                (CPCAY) said that it would consider letting some of its pilots live abroad for a few months as aircrew continued to face arduous self-isolation measures. The carrier later said that its workers spent more than 73,000 nights in government-mandated quarantine in 2021.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            French spirits maker Pernod Ricard\n            \n                (PDRDF) has also asked top executives from its Hong Kong office to work abroad for some time, according to unidentified sources who spoke with the FT. The company did not respond to repeated requests for comment. \n    \n\n    \n            Meanwhile, other players have moved away entirely.\n    \n\n    \n            In November, FedEx\n            \n                (FDX) said it would shut down its crew base in Hong Kong and relocate pilots, citing the city’s “pandemic requirements.”\n    \n\n    \n            From the start of the pandemic through the end of last year, at least 84 companies have either closed or moved their regional headquarters out of Hong Kong, according to CNN Business calculations based on government data. \n    \n\n    \n            Asked about the figure, a government spokesperson responded that “Hong Kong remains a competitive city globally and a major regional base for international companies.”\n    \n\n    \n            The representative also pointed to emerging opportunities in the Greater Bay Area, a zone connecting Hong Kong, the southern Chinese province of Guangdong and the city of Macao as “a market of 86 million people.” Many banks have honed in on the area as a key priority in the coming years. \n    \n\n    \n            The government, which includes mainland Chinese companies in its annual tally of international businesses in Hong Kong, said that the number had recently “risen to a record high of 9,049.”\n    \n\n    \n            But the exodus amongst Western players may not slow down this year. \n    \n\n    \n            BASF\n            \n                (BASFY), a German chemicals giant, recently relocated its chief for Asia Pacific, excluding Greater China, to Singapore “after careful consideration of her office’s strategic location in the region,” according to the company.\n    \n\n    \n            The decision was based on “the requirement for proximity to relevant stakeholders and markets,” it told CNN Business in a statement.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Others may be biding their time. Hong Kong recently brought forward the end of the school year for some institutions to March or April, giving families more time to reevaluate their options before the new term begins in September.\n    \n\n    \n            In some sectors, bonus season typically takes place around this period, too.\n    \n\n    \n            “I suspect there’s a lot of international bankers who may be waiting till then before they decide whether they’ve had their fill of Hong Kong,” said a person working in the finance industry, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.\n    \n\n  \n    Free flights and country clubs\n\n\n    \n            This exodus means that top companies in the city are working extra hard to attract — and retain — skilled workers. \n    \n\n    \n            Two senior headhunters in Hong Kong said that job candidates were increasingly pricing in the inconvenience of living in the city — if they were even persuaded to do so.\n    \n\n    \n            “Most of them are just kind of immediately saying no,” said John Mullally, regional director of Southern China and Hong Kong financial services at recruitment agency Robert Walters. \n    \n\n    \n            “You’ve got a smaller candidate pool, especially when it comes to those with overseas experience.”\n    \n\n    \n            Mark Tibbatts, managing director of Southern China and Taiwan for the agency Michael Page, described it as “an ongoing battle” that had made it “nigh on impossible” to lure international talent.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The circumstances have revived the so-called “expat package,” which had mostly been scrapped in recent years, according to both recruiters.\n    \n\n    \n            “Let’s go back a couple of decades. Most of the senior expats in Hong Kong were on a pretty juicy package that might have included flights home, and education, and club memberships and all these types of things,” said Tibbatts. “Over the last, let’s say, 10, 15 years, most of that’s been phased out.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Now, some of those deals are “coming back,” he added.\n    \n\n    \n            Mullally also described a rising view that Hong Kong was becoming “a bit of a hardship posting” for expats, a term that typically refers to a place with hostile living conditions.\n    \n\n    \n            That perception was more common from the 1970s to early 1990s, and back then justified more perks for businesspeople, he said.\n    \n\n    \n            Now, companies are “going to have to try to bring that back because … realistically, if you want to attract people, that’s kind of the package you’ll have to put together.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            As international executives jump ship, blue-collar workers and the city’s poorest are being left behind to face the darkening economic outlook. \n    \n\n    \n            It’s not just in Hong Kong: Inequality around the world has worsened throughout the pandemic, with billionaires making unprecedented gains in wealth as tens of millions of people fall into poverty. \n    \n\n    \n            Despite a growing shortage of domestic workers in Hong Kong, “it is not easy to say whether [the pandemic] has as a whole positively or negatively impacted them,” said Manisha Wijesinghe, executive director of HELP for Domestic Workers.\n    \n\n    \n            “We definitely have seen a number of domestic workers who are being offered higher than statutorily mandated wages due to the shortage of incoming domestic workers,” she said.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “But we have also seen domestic workers being forced to take on salaries lower than the minimum allowable wage … there is a power imbalance.” \n    \n\n    \n            From January 2020 to the end of 2021, the city’s number of domestic workers dropped from more than 400,000 to roughly 340,000, according to government statistics. \n    \n\n    \n            In a recent blog post, Hong Kong Labor Secretary Law Chi-kwong pointed to flight bans from certain countries as a possible reason for the slump, saying that some workers had likely been stranded abroad.\n    \n\n    \n            When asked about the plight of domestic workers, authorities told CNN Business that foreign workers who test positive for Covid-19 “will receive support and medical treatment like local people in Hong Kong.” And, if unemployed, they will be admitted to community isolation facilities, they said. \n    \n\n    \n            A government spokesperson also said that it “has continuously reminded employers of their statutory obligations and requirements” during the pandemic, and “any breach of such requirements will render them ineligible to employ [a domestic worker] for a period of time.” \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            While big international firms may have the privilege to up and move, most local businesses have no choice but to hunker down.\n    \n\n    \n            As many as 50,000 small businesses could shut down over the city’s fifth wave of Covid, estimates Danny Lau, chairman of the Hong Kong Small and Medium Enterprises Association.\n    \n\n    \n            That’s about one in seven such registered entities across the city — and there could be more, he said.\n    \n\n    \n            Despite soaring infections, Hong Kong officials have been holding onto the “zero Covid” strategy in recent weeks, introducing social distancing restrictions that have stifled local activity. \n    \n\n    \n            Many places, such as beauty parlors and fitness studios, have been forced to stop operating for months until the current measures end.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            “They don’t have any income. Zero income,” Lau said of those business owners. He added that some had resorted to operating secretly just to keep making a living.\n    \n\n    \n            Like elsewhere, small businesses had already been hit hard earlier in the pandemic, especially by the lack of tourists.\n    \n\n    \n            These firms were “almost half dead,” said Lau, noting that some entrepreneurs had already taken out significant loans or dug into their reserves just to stay afloat.\n    \n\n    \n            “The worst thing is you cannot see the future,” he added. “We don’t know how long these restrictions will last for.”\n    \n\n

According to a report by consulting firm Bain & Company, the salary of entry-level developers in India is 85% less than their counterparts in the United States.\n    \n\n  \n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “If you are building a SaaS company in the US, it is better to have a million-dollar client rather than a $10,000-client because you need to pay for sales and marketing in that country,” said Prasanna Krishnamoorthy, managing partner at SaaS accelerator Upekkha. “When you are serving customers from India, you can have these small and mid-sized companies, as well as large ones.”\n    \n\n    \n            Most SaaS companies focus on global clients, similar to the strategy that was followed by India’s IT giants such as TCS and Infosys\n            \n                (INFY). Investors see this as a welcome change, since most of India’s oldest unicorns — from Flipkart to Paytm — have focused primarily on the domestic market.\n    \n\n    \n            Almost 98% of Fortune 500 companies use Postman’s products, according to Asthana, while Freshworks’ first client was based in Australia. \n    \n\n    \n            SaaS firms are much better placed to go global than e-commerce companies like India’s Flipkart, for example. They write software once, and then are able to use it multiple times.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “For a Flipkart you need billions of dollars [to grow internationally], but for a Freshwork you need much less capital to go global,” said Mathrubootham, who is also an investor in Postman. This is because e-commerce firms require a ton of money to set up physical operations elsewhere — they have to hire delivery drivers, rent warehouses and buy inventory.\n    \n\n    \n            Bhatnagar of Sequoia Capital said that Indian software entrepreneurs “mastered” the art of “remote sales” fairly early. “Honestly, in this last two years, the whole world has had to understand how to do better remote sales,” he added.\n    \n\n    \n            Despite the euphoria, there are some hurdles Indian companies have to overcome before they can deliver on the $1 trillion promise. \n    \n\n    \n            Indian engineers trained in the IT services industry may find it hard to develop the discipline required to build a product-focused company.\n    \n\n    \n            In IT services, “you are selling bodies and you say yes to everything the customer says,” said Krishnamoorthy. SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added. \n    \n\n    \n            And India’s startup ecosytem is still relatively immature when compared to Silicon Valley. Despite the massive size of some homegrown unicorns, Mathrubootham said that the country does not have a “global tech powerhouse product brand.” \n    \n\n    \n            But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that. \n    \n\n    \n            “It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,” he added.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 7494, 'description': 'More than two decades ago, India began its transformation into a global IT powerhouse, ushering in an era of wealth and job creation never before seen in the country.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210906090533-freshworks-office-file.jpg?q=x_46,y_215,h_874,w_1554,c_crop/w_800', 'date': '2021-09-09T09:43:22Z', 'keywords': ['asia', ' continents and regions', ' india', ' south asia', ' technology', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' computer science and information technology', ' software and applications', ' banking', ' finance and investments', ' company activities and management', ' company strategy', ' financial markets and investing', ' startups', ' companies', ' salesforce', ' unicorns', ' freight transportation', ' postal services', ' transportation and warehousing'], 'summary': ['Other Indian SaaS firms have found traction by focusing on niche businesses.', 'Zenoti, for example, is a unicorn that builds software for the spa and beauty salon industry.', 'Many of them have worked at some of the biggest global tech companies.', 'Now, Postman is India’s most valuable SaaS unicorn, with a valuation of $5.6 billion.', 'The low cost of operating in India is a big plus.', 'SaaS companies, on the other hand, have to say no to 99% of [potential] customers, he added.', 'But he hoped that future SaaS companies can change that.', '“It is my personal dream to see India as a product nation,” he added.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 49, 'comparative': 0.04487179487179487, 'calculation': [{'dream': 1}, {'no': -1}, {'yes': 1}, {'hard': -1}, {'promise': 1}, {'euphoria': 3}, {'better': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'better': 2}, {'fortune': 2}, {'focused': 2}, {'welcome': 2}, {'pay': -1}, {'better': 2}, {'united': 1}, {'big': 1}, {'problem': -2}, {'rise': 1}, {'thanks': 2}, {'excited': 3}, {'reached': 1}, {'beauty': 3}, {'help': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'opportunity': 2}, {'big': 1}, {'worth': 2}, {'worth': 2}, {'secure': 2}, {'care': 2}, {'safe': 1}, {'huge': 1}, {'forced': -1}, {'like': 2}, {'big': 1}, {'wealth': 3}], 'postive': ['dream', 'yes', 'promise', 'euphoria', 'better', 'like', 'better', 'fortune', 'focused', 'welcome', 'better', 'united', 'big', 'rise', 'thanks', 'excited', 'reached', 'beauty', 'help', 'like', 'opportunity', 'big', 'worth', 'worth', 'secure', 'care', 'safe', 'huge', 'like', 'big', 'wealth'], 'negative': ['no', 'hard', 'pay', 'problem', 'forced']}}"

Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu is a Rolex Awards Laureate.\n\n\n  \n      \n      CNN\n        \xa0—\xa0\n    \n\n\n    \n            In the bustling Ogere Market in Ogun State, Nigeria, the race is on to sell fresh produce early in the day. By noon, the sun is at its peak, and with temperatures soaring, food spoils fast. As the day wears on, food can sell at less than half of its original value, slashing profits for retailers and farmers. \n    \n\n    \n            That’s why Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu decided to take a fresh approach to food waste. He’s the founder of ColdHubs, which provides solar-powered food storage units designed for markets and farms. \n    \n\n    \n            The 39-year-old has won countless awards for the initiative and has just been announced as the joint winner of the $1.5 million AYuTe Africa Challenge, for promising young innovators who are using technology to reimagine food production on the continent. \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n    \n            Officially launched in 2015, ColdHubs now has 54 units in 22 states across Nigeria. More than 5,250 smallholder farmers, retailers, and wholesalers use its cold rooms and in 2020, the company stored 40,000 tons of food, reducing waste and increasing farmers’ profits.  \n    \n\n    \n            “This is food meant for human consumption that we typically lose along the supply chain, either during harvesting, transportation, or distribution,” says Ikegwuonu. “The mission really is to reduce food spoilage due to lack of cold food storage at key points along the food supply chain.” \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Nigeria is ranked 100 out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Index. Over 88 million people in the country face food insecurity and 12% are undernourished. \n    \n\n    \n            The problem isn’t a lack of food, though: it’s an excess of waste. An alarming 40% of the food Nigeria produces every year is lost before it even reaches consumers. That’s equal to 31% of its total land use, according to the World Bank, and accounts for 5% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Ikegwuonu’s ColdHubs are 10-foot-square cold storage units which keep produce fresh for up to 21 days. Conventional cold storage units of this size would be powered by diesel generators and require 20 to 30 liters of diesel every day, says Ikegwuonu – but by using solar panels instead, he says that across all its units, the company prevents over 1 million kilograms of CO2 entering the atmosphere each year, while powering the units 24/7. \n    \n\n    \n            According to the UN, food waste accounts for up to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so finding solutions to reduce waste could be vital in the fight against climate change. \n    \n\n    \n            Storing a crate of produce in the ColdHub costs around 25 cents per day, and has helped farmers and retailers double their monthly earnings, says Ikegwuonu: “This has been achieved by selling produce that was previously thrown away, sold off at the right price.” \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Looking to the future, Ikegwuonu says ColdHubs is also developing technology to freeze produce, for fishing communities in the Niger Delta. “Most of the coastal communities don’t have access to energy at all,” he says, adding that these freezer storage units would also have the capacity to produce ice blocks. \n    \n\n    \n            Ikegwuonu also wants to extend his social impact by creating gender parity and jobs in a country where around 35% of all employment is in agriculture, and 90% of rural livelihoods depend on it.\n    \n\n    \n            “We have been able to create about 66 new jobs for women,” he says. “Many of these women have become empowered and change agents in their households and communities.”\n    \n\n    \n            Ikegwuonu says his current focus is on expanding the business further in Nigeria – but in the next decade, he has his sights set on other countries struggling with similar food waste problems. \n    \n\n    \n            “The big dream for us is to solve the problem of food spoilage in Nigeria, and expand our technology and service to other African countries that have these challenges,” he says. \n    \n\n  \n\n       \n    \n\n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n\n          \n        \n          \n      \n      \n    ', 'length': 4851, 'description': 'Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu’s startup ColdHubs provides solar-powered food storage units designed to keep food fresh at markets and farms.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210917161352-05-coldhubs.jpg?q=x_10,y_0,h_1952,w_3468,c_crop/w_800', 'date': '2021-09-23T08:15:42Z', 'keywords': ['africa', ' agriculture', ' agriculture', ' forestry', ' and commercial fishing', ' air pollution', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' climate change', ' continents and regions', ' energy and environment', ' energy and utilities', ' environment and natural resources', ' farm workers', ' food and drink', ' greenhouse gases', ' labor and employment', ' nigeria', ' pollution', ' western africa', ' workers and professionals', ' environmentalism', ' renewable energy', ' solar energy'], 'summary': ['By noon, the sun is at its peak, and with temperatures soaring, food spoils fast.', 'That’s why Nnaemeka Ikegwuonu decided to take a fresh approach to food waste.', 'Nigeria is ranked 100 out of 113 countries on the Global Food Security Index.', 'Over 88 million people in the country face food insecurity and 12% are undernourished.', 'The problem isn’t a lack of food, though: it’s an excess of waste.', 'An alarming 40% of the food Nigeria produces every year is lost before it even reaches consumers.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 2, 'comparative': 0.0029940119760479044, 'calculation': [{'expand': 1}, {'problem': -2}, {'solve': 1}, {'dream': 1}, {'big': 1}, {'problems': -2}, {'waste': -1}, {'struggling': -2}, {'extend': 1}, {'blocks': -1}, {'fight': -1}, {'waste': -1}, {'solutions': 1}, {'waste': -1}, {'prevents': -1}, {'fresh': 1}, {'reaches': 1}, {'lost': -3}, {'waste': -1}, {'lack': -2}, {'problem': -2}, {'lack': -2}, {'profits': 2}, {'waste': -1}, {'launched': 1}, {'challenge': -1}, {'winner': 4}, {'awards': 3}, {'won': 3}, {'waste': -1}, {'fresh': 1}, {'profits': 2}, {'slashing': -2}, {'fresh': 1}, {'awards': 3}, {'fresh': 1}], 'postive': ['expand', 'solve', 'dream', 'big', 'extend', 'solutions', 'fresh', 'reaches', 'profits', 'launched', 'winner', 'awards', 'won', 'fresh', 'profits', 'fresh', 'awards', 'fresh'], 'negative': ['problem', 'problems', 'waste', 'struggling', 'blocks', 'fight', 'waste', 'waste', 'prevents', 'lost', 'waste', 'lack', 'problem', 'lack', 'waste', 'challenge', 'waste', 'slashing']}}"

Lester says that she is “grateful” that now “people are actually responding and recognizing it as a big problem and making changes to address it.” \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            “I think it’s important to increase representation across the board because … who knows what young mind this inspires when they see themselves represented in this way, who might be inspired to go into science or become a physician or nurse or something like that, by seeing themselves depicted in these illustrations?” she adds.\n    \n\n    \n            Studies have shown this lack of diversity. A 2014 study by researchers at the University of Wollongong in Australia examined gender bias in anatomy textbooks and found that of more than 6,000 images with an identifiable sex published between 2008 and 2013 in 17 textbooks, the vast majority were White and just over a third were female. About 3% showed disabled bodies and 2% featured elderly people.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            In some Western countries, people of color have been disproportionately affected by the Covid pandemic. Research by the CDC found that racial and ethnic minority groups have had higher rates of hospitalization and emergency care for Covid-19 than White people in the US. \n    \n\n    \n            Lester says that “Covid-19 has highlighted a lot of issues of disparities, and that has led us to think about disparities and all the ways that they show up, including in dermatology.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            Lester co-authored a research letter published in the British Journal of Dermatology in May 2020 which found that scientific articles describing the skin manifestations of Covid-19 “almost exclusively show(ed) clinical images from patients with lighter skin,” with no published photos of the manifestations in dark skin. It noted that this may make it more difficult for dermatologists and the public to identify the virus.\n    \n\n    \n            This is compounded by the issue of some medical equipment not working as effectively on people with darker skin tones. Pulse oximeters, which measure a patient’s oxygen level by using light and a sensor to detect the color of the blood, and which have been increasingly used during the pandemic, have been found to provide less accurate readings on darker skin. If they are not calibrated for darker skin tones, the pigmentation could affect how the light is absorbed.\n    \n\n    \n            “It’s not just about the skin conditions,” says Ibe. “It’s just about giving everybody the value that they deserve. Black, White, Asian – let’s all have equal healthcare that we deserve.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Despite making up an eighth of the world’s population, Africa accounted for less than 1% of global research output between 2012 and 2016. Even in Nigeria, White skin images dominate the medical literature, says Ibe. His goal is to help remedy that by setting up a network of African medical illustrators.\n    \n\n    \n            Ibe plans to become a pediatric neurosurgeon and is also working on a textbook on birth defects in children, which will be illustrated with Black skin images.\n    \n\n    \n            “I want it to be a norm that whenever a person searches online for a particular skin condition, a particular health challenge, that the first pop-ups are Black illustrations or are illustrations of people of color,” he says.\n    \n\n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n\n          \n        \n          \n      \n      \n    ', 'length': 6469, 'description': 'Chidiebere Ibe is a Nigerian medical student who wants his drawings to promote diversity in medical illustrations.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220112142208-restricted-chidiebere-medical-illustration-1-story.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-01-13T08:47:04Z', 'keywords': ['business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' dermatology', ' diversity', ' health and medical', ' media industry', ' medical fields and specialties', ' minority and ethnic groups', ' publishing industry', ' societal issues', ' society'], 'summary': ['“Mind the Gap: A clinical handbook of signs and symptoms in Black and Brown Skin,” was first published in 2020.', 'Ibe says that a lack of illustrations of skin conditions in Black skin makes it hard for medical students to diagnose them.', 'About 3% showed disabled bodies and 2% featured elderly people.', 'If they are not calibrated for darker skin tones, the pigmentation could affect how the light is absorbed.', '“It’s not just about the skin conditions,” says Ibe.', 'Black, White, Asian – let’s all have equal healthcare that we deserve.”', 'His goal is to help remedy that by setting up a network of African medical illustrators.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 4, 'comparative': 0.004171011470281543, 'calculation': [{'challenge': -1}, {'want': 1}, {'defects': -3}, {'help': 2}, {'absorbed': 1}, {'effectively': 2}, {'difficult': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'care': 2}, {'emergency': -2}, {'affected': -1}, {'bias': -1}, {'lack': -2}, {'like': 2}, {'inspired': 2}, {'inspires': 2}, {'increase': 1}, {'important': 2}, {'problem': -2}, {'big': 1}, {'certain': 1}, {'care': 2}, {'comfortable': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'hopes': 2}, {'hard': -1}, {'lack': -2}, {'injuries': -2}, {'infection': -2}, {'disorder': -2}, {'allow': -1}, {'ensure': 1}, {'creative': 2}, {'lack': -2}], 'postive': ['want', 'help', 'absorbed', 'effectively', 'care', 'like', 'inspired', 'inspires', 'increase', 'important', 'big', 'certain', 'care', 'comfortable', 'like', 'hopes', 'ensure', 'creative'], 'negative': ['challenge', 'defects', 'difficult', 'no', 'emergency', 'affected', 'bias', 'lack', 'problem', 'hard', 'lack', 'injuries', 'infection', 'disorder', 'allow', 'lack']}}"

  \n            It’s the fuel that powers performance – few things are as important to an elite athlete as their diet.\n    \n\n    \n            Eating the right nutrients is critical to success, but so is the odd indulgent meal to keep spirits high through grueling training sessions. \n    \n\n    \n            And as the Winter Olympics comes to an end, a new cookbook provides a glimpse into what makes top athletes tick.\n    \n\n    \n            The Winning Recipes cookbook is the idea of the Purple Project, an organization that looks to support domestic abuse survivors, which has worked over the past year to create a gastronomic tome made up of the favorite recipes from some of the US’ best Olympic athletes. \n    \n\n    \n            “The Purple Project reached out to me out of the blue,” retired Olympic skier Noah Hoffman, who was invited to take part, told CNN Sport. \n    \n\n    \n            “At first, I thought, ‘That’s a little strange, I’m not a chef. I don’t know if I can contribute to a cookbook.’ \n    \n\n    \n            “But, of course, I love to cook. I think everybody loves to eat and I love to eat, and I have favorite recipes. \n    \n\n    \n            “I actually sat down with my partner and we came up with the recipe together and made it once or twice to make sure that we had it correct.”\n    \n\n    \n            Hoffman’s offering of ‘Berry Dutch Baby’ can be found in the breakfast section, but even he admits it’s designed for someone with a very sweet tooth. \n    \n\n    \n            The recipe, which involves fried frozen berries underneath a baked doughy pastry, was a favorite of Hoffman’s during his career but only on the odd occasion. \n    \n\n    \n            “Certainly, only on days off,” he said laughing. “It’s a little bit time intensive and maybe not the best training fuel, but a nice treat on a recovery day.”\n    \n\n\n    \n            READ: Canada-born Humphries wins gold medal for US after \u200bfiling harassment complaint\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Hoffman retired from competitive skiing after the PyeongChang Games in 2018 but enjoyed a long career which involved two Winter Olympic Games.\n    \n\n    \n            He specialized in endurance events and would push his body “to the limit” during training in order to reap the rewards come race day.\n    \n\n    \n            Hoffman says he would consume food “endlessly” during training blocks. \n    \n\n    \n            He even remembers sitting down to eat over one pound of pasta for lunch. \n    \n\n    \n            “There was a time in my early 20s, when I was still growing, that I was eating at least 8,000 calories a day. It’s an incredible amount of food,” he said, before remembering some of the tricks he used to boost the calorie intake.  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “So you cook a whole box of pasta and you eat it all in one sitting for lunch. It’s just astounding.\n    \n\n    \n            “I don’t advise that for any young athlete, but I couldn’t fill myself up. I was just eating constantly. It was wild.”\n    \n\n    \n            Hoffman’s eating habits changed slightly as he became more successful and he worked with a dietitian for much of his career. \n    \n\n    \n            The US ski team employed nutritionists to help its athletes reach their optimal levels of fitness and Hoffman still looks after what he eats even after retiring from competitive skiing. \n    \n\n\n    \n

the years and so has the role of athletes in general. \n    \n\n    \n            Like many have done since the pandemic, Hoffman wants to use his platform as an athlete to change society for the better. \n    \n\n    \n            He confesses to not knowing much about domestic abuse rates prior to working on this initiative but says he’s been “humbled” to learn more about the work the Purple Project is doing. \n    \n\n    \n            According to the organization, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the US, so the Purple Project looks to provide aid and support for emergency domestic violence shelters.\n    \n\n    \n            “I do think the role of an athlete has changed, and I think that’s kind of part of a societal change where politics seem to be a little more central and, unfortunately, a little more divided as a whole.\n    \n\n    \n            “So I think that as that happens, athletes like everybody feel the need to speak out and really feel passionately and want to see the world a better place.\n    \n\n    \n            “So athletes are really wanting to give back and are understanding that they have a lot of leverage and a lot of power to help organizations that they want to help.\n    \n\n    \n            “So I was just really honored to be included in this project … and getting to learn about the Purple Project and all the work that they do.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 5064, 'description': 'It’s the fuel that powers performance – few things are as important to an elite athlete as their diet.',

discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination. \n    \n\n    \n            On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan. More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes. \n    \n\n    \n            Three reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant melted down, releasing radioactive materials into the air and more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the area. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n\n    \n            Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.\n    \n\n    \n            Using remote cameras, researchers from the University of Georgia recovered more than 267,000 photos of more than 20 species – including racoon dogs, wild boars, macaques, pheasants, foxes and Japanese hares in the areas surrounding the power plant.\n    \n\n    \n            “Our results represent the first evidence that numerous species of wildlife are now abundant throughout the Fukushima Evacuation Zone, despite the presence of radiological contamination,” James Beasley, associate professor at the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory and the Warnell School of Forestry and Natural Resources, said in a statement.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Photographic data was collected from 106 camera sites from three zones: Areas where humans were excluded due to the highest level of contamination; areas where humans were restricted due to an intermediate level of contamination; and areas where people were allowed to remain.\n    \n\n    \n            Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited. \n    \n\n    \n            In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Researchers also saw higher numbers of racoons, Japanese marten, a weasel-like animal, and Japanese macaque or monkeys in uninhabited or restricted zones. \n    \n\n\n    \n            Species considered to be “in conflict” with humans, such as wild boar, were predominantly photographed in areas and zones evacuated by humans, Beasley said.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            While the research monitors the radiological impact on wildlife populations as a whole, it does not give an assessment on the health of individual animals, scientists noted. \n    \n\n    \n            The study was published Monday in the Journal of Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, was produced in addition to the team’s research on Chernobyl, where wildlife has also thrived in the wake of the disaster.\n    \n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n\n          \n        \n          \n      \n      \n    ', 'length': 3099, 'description': 'Nearly a decade after Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster, researchers have discovered that wildlife is thriving in the areas evacuated by humans, despite radiological contamination.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200107065451-02-animal-life-fukushima-intl.jpg?q=x_730,y_552,h_884,w_1571,c_crop/w_800', 'date': '2020-01-07T17:38:23Z', 'keywords': ['2011 japan nuclear crisis', ' accidents', ' accidents', ' disasters and safety', ' animals', ' asia', ' continents and regions', ' east asia', ' environment and natural resources', ' fukushima', ' japan', ' life forms', ' nuclear accidents', ' wildlife'], 'summary': ['On March 11, 2011, a 9.0 magnitude earthquake hit Japan.', 'More than 20,000 people died or went missing in the quake and tsunami, while hundreds of thousands more lost their homes.', 'Scientists have now discovered that wildlife is abundant in areas that humans no longer live.', 'Over 120 days, cameras captured 46,000 photographs of wild boar, with more than 26,000 images taken in the areas which were uninhabited.', 'In contrast, about 13,000 images were taken in zones where humans were restricted due to contamination and 7,000 taken in zones inhabited by people.'], 'sentiment': {'score': -34, 'comparative': -0.08695652173913043, 'calculation': [{'disaster': -2}, {'evacuated': -1}, {'restricted': -2}, {'contamination': -2}, {'restricted': -2}, {'contamination': -2}, {'restricted': -2}, {'contamination': -2}, {'excluded': -2}, {'natural': 1}, {'contamination': -2}, {'evacuation': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'evacuated': -1}, {'lost': -3}, {'missing': -2}, {'died': -3}, {'contamination': -2}, {'evacuated': -1}, {'disaster': -2}], 'postive': ['natural'], 'negative': ['disaster', 'evacuated', 'restricted', 'contamination', 'restricted', 'contamination', 'restricted', 'contamination', 'excluded', 'contamination', 'evacuation', 'no', 'evacuated', 'lost', 'missing', 'died', 'contamination', 'evacuated', 'disaster']}}"

But I’m not giving up.”\n    \n\n    \n            Williams was forced to miss January’s Australian Open following the advice of her medical team, announcing in December that she wasn’t “where I need to be physically to compete.”\n    \n\n    \n            Speaking to Amanpour in Paris, Williams said she will play at the French Open in May – the next grand slam in the tennis calendar – if her body allows.\n    \n\n    \n            “Paris is one of my favorite cities, and I actually love the clay. So we’ll see what happens. Hopefully if my body is holding up, then I’ll definitely be there.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Williams’ rise from a young girl learning to play tennis on dilapidated courts in Compton, California, to become one of the most successful and decorated athletes in history is the stuff of legend.\n    \n\n    \n            Now immortalized in the Hollywood film “King Richard” – which Williams and her sister Venus executive produced – their father was pivotal in the duo’s development as players.\n    \n\n    \n            Played by Will Smith, the film shows how Richard Williams catapulted his daughters to tennis stardom.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Often portrayed as a divisive and eccentric character, Williams told CNN how the sisters aimed to change the narrative around their dad.\n    \n\n    \n            “Unfortunately, entering a new sport where it’s predominantly, you know, White and having my dad have like this villain character, when it just wasn’t true, just having to deal with that my entire career, from day one to the very end, was just really important for us just to tell the truth,” she said.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “You know, in order to be an athlete, especially in a single sport, it takes a lot of work, and it takes a lot of dedication. And I look at my daughter and I say, ‘Wow, I don’t think I could do what my dad did every single day.’ It’s a lot of work.”\n    \n\n    \n            Serena’s older sister Venus paved the way, turning professional one year earlier than her, winning seven grand slam singles titles so far in her career. Venus still competes on the tour, aged 41.\n    \n\n    \n            Initially, Serena lived in Venus’ shadow.\n    \n\n    \n            “My sister was much better than me. I was not very good growing up. And so, everyone was focused on Venus. And in the film, it goes into that, how when we had an opportunity to have better coaches, they saw that Venus was the one.\n    \n\n    \n            “And so, that was devastating for me … but helpful. Because if that hadn’t happened, I wouldn’t have had the career that I have because I felt like I just had to prove and just had to win.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Williams turned to her mother, Oracene Price, who played a critical but often overlooked role in her success.\n    \n\n    \n            “I just had to work with mom. I didn’t get to work with the prestigious coaches or anything. And my mom made me tough mentally,” she added.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Serena, Venus and their dad came up against racism throughout their careers, most notably in 2001 at Indian Wells.\n    \n\n    \n            Asked by Amanpour how they perceived and overcame the racism that they experienced as tennis players in a predominantly White sport, Williams responded: “We changed it from being two great Black champions to being the best ever, period. And that’s what we did. We took out color, and we just became the best.\n    \n\n    \n            “And yes, we had to play harder, and we had to be better, but it made us better.\n    \n\n    \n            “And at the end of the day, every time we faced a challenge and every time we overcame that challenge, we created Venus and Serena.”\n    \n\n    \n            Williams also discussed her venture fund Serena Ventures, which this week announced $111 million had been raised to invest in founders of diverse backgrounds.\n    \n\n    \n            “It’s really about diversity,” Williams told Amanpour, explaining that she was spurred to action when she learnt that less than 2% of all venture capital money went to women.\n    \n\n    \n            “Because of tennis, I have a way to impact VC in a different way and bringing diversity to that as well,” she said.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n    Double standards\n\n\n    \n            At times, Williams has shown anger and exasperation with umpires on the court, most infamously at the 2018 US Open final which she lost to Naomi Osaka.\n    \n\n    \n            She was heavily criticized and fined over the episode.\n    \n\n    \n            Amanpour asked Williams if she feels double standards exist in the sport, given men routinely act out at umpires, often with impunity.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Responding to a recent incident involving German player Alexander Zverev, in which he struck the umpire’s chair multiple times with his racket and was subsequently withdrawn from the Mexican Open and fined, Williams said: “There is absolutely a double standard.

Then it bounced on the pitch, spun dramatically and missed Gatting’s bat before astonishingly hitting the off-stump. \n    \n\n    \n            Like many others, Gatting looked astounded that such an initially harmless-looking delivery had cost him his wicket –  former England player Graham Gooch said: “He looked as though someone had just nicked his lunch.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Warne’s ability to flight and spin the ball to such devastating effect helped revive leg-spin from a forgotten art into a key component in modern day cricket. \n    \n\n    \n            “The highlight of my cricketing career was to keep wicket to Warnie,” Adam Gilchrist, Australia’s legendary wicketkeeper and Warne’s longtime teammate, wrote on Twitter.\n    \n\n    \n            “Best seat in the house to watch the maestro at work. Have often felt a tad selfish, that Heals and I pretty much exclusively are the only ones who had that thrill and pleasure at Test level. Rip Warnie.\n    \n\n    \n            Other cricket greats were quick to pay tribute to Warne’s remarkable talent.\n    \n\n    \n            “Shocked, stunned & miserable,” wrote Indian Sachin Tendulkar – widely considered one of the best batters of all time.\n    \n\n    \n            “There was never a dull moment with you around, on or off the field. Will always treasure our on field duels & off field banter. You always had a special place for India & Indians had a special place for you. \n    \n\n    \n            “Gone too young!”\n    \n\n    \n            Former India international batter Virender Sehwag said on Twitter: “One of the greatest spinners, the man who made spin cool, superstar Shane Warne is no more.\n    \n\n    \n            “Life is very fragile, but this is very difficult to fathom. My heartfelt condolences to his family, friends and fans all around the world.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            During his career which spanned over 20 years, Warne won numerous trophies and accolades.\n    \n\n    \n            In Australia’s victorious World Cup team in 1999, Warne collected the man of the match award in the final. He was named one of Wisden’s five best players of the 20th century, as well as being selected in an all-time Test World XI by Wisden to commemorate 150 years of the cricketers’ almanack. \n    \n\n    \n            Away from international cricket, Warne also played a pivotal role in making the Indian Premier League (IPL) the behemoth it is today. \n    \n\n    \n            In 2008, he led the Rajasthan Royals to the inaugural IPL title, something he believes gave the tournament “credibility because the underdog came good.” \n    \n\n    \n            “To then go and win it in the style we did, that put the IPL on the map. Any underdog story like that – you look at Leicester City, what they did. It’s a pretty amazing story,” Warne told CNN in 2019, referring to the soccer underdog’s remarkable Premier League title triumph in 2016.\n    \n\n    \n            “I was very lucky to play in an era of Australian cricket where we were super successful. We beat every team home and away, won World Cups, Ashes series, so we had some huge results.\n    \n\n    \n            “To be part of all of that with the Aussies and do those things was great but the IPL, it was completely different.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Warne played his entire domestic cricket career in Australia with his native Victoria, but had stints with Hampshire in England. \n    \n\n    \n            “Absolutely shocked and gutted to hear about Shane Warne, wrote former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara. “Legend and friend. Just can’t believe it.”\n    \n\n    \n            Former West Indies batter Vivian Richards also said on Twitter: “Unbelievable. I am shocked to the core. This can’t be true… Rest In Peace, Shane Warne. There are no words to describe what I feel right now. A huge loss for cricket.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 6648, 'description': 'Whether it was his bleach blonde hair or his devastating spin bowling which had batters quivering and quaking, Shane Warne did things his own way.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220304141024-shane-warne-old.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-04T17:41:08Z', 'keywords': ['death and dying', ' deaths and fatalities', ' shane warne', ' society', ' sports figures', ' australia', ' continents and regions', ' england', ' europe', ' internet and www', ' northern europe', ' oceania', ' social media', ' technology', ' united kingdom', ' bowling', ' companies', ' sports and recreation', ' twitter'], 'summary': ['The delivery looked to be heading past England batter Mike Gatting’s leg stump.', 'Rip Warnie.', 'Other cricket greats were quick to pay tribute to Warne’s remarkable talent.', 'During his career which spanned over 20 years, Warne won numerous trophies and accolades.', '“I was very lucky to play in an era of Australian cricket where we were super successful.', 'We beat every team home and away, won World Cups, Ashes series, so we had some huge results.', 'This can’t be true… Rest In Peace, Shane Warne.', 'A huge loss for cricket.”'], 'sentiment': {'score': 87, 'comparative': 0.08770161290322581, 'calculation': [{'loss': -3}, {'huge': 1}, {'no': -1}, {'peace': 2}, {'shocked': -2}, {'friend': 1}, {'shocked': -2}, {'great': 3}, {'huge': 1}, {'won': 3}, {'successful': 3}, {'super': 3}, {'lucky': 3}, {'triumph': 4}, {'remarkable': 2}, {'amazing': 4}, {'pretty': 1}, {'like': 2}, {'win': 4}, {'good': 3}, {'best': 3}, {'award': 3}, {'won': 3}, {'heartfelt': 3}, {'difficult': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'cool': 1}, {'greatest': 3}, {'treasure': 2}, {'dull': -2}, {'best': 3}, {'miserable': -3}, {'stunned': -2}, {'talent': 2}, {'remarkable': 2}, {'tribute': 2}, {'pay': -1}, {'pleasure': 3}, {'pretty': 1}, {'selfish': -3}, {'highlight': 2}, {'forgotten': -1}, {'revive': 2}, {'devastating': -2}, {'ability': 2}, {'astounded': 3}, {'like': 2}, {'missed': -2}, {'famous': 2}, {'bright': 1}, {'success': 2}, {'engage': 1}, {'happy': 3}, {'capable': 1}, {'peace': 2}, {'favorite': 2}, {'hero': 2}, {'win': 4}, {'charisma': 2}, {'loved': 3}, {'great': 3}, {'winning': 4}, {'leading': 2}, {'greatest': 3}, {'attack': -1}, {'suspected': -1}, {'died': -3}, {'great': 3}, {'quaking': -2}, {'devastating': -2}], 'postive': ['huge', 'peace', 'friend', 'great', 'huge', 'won', 'successful', 'super', 'lucky', 'triumph', 'remarkable', 'amazing', 'pretty', 'like', 'win', 'good', 'best', 'award', 'won', 'heartfelt', 'cool', 'greatest', 'treasure', 'best', 'talent', 'remarkable', 'tribute', 'pleasure', 'pretty', 'highlight', 'revive', 'ability', 'astounded', 'like', 'famous', 'bright', 'success', 'engage', 'happy', 'capable', 'peace', 'favorite', 'hero', 'win', 'charisma', 'loved', 'great', 'winning', 'leading', 'greatest', 'great'], 'negative': ['loss', 'no', 'shocked', 'shocked', 'difficult', 'no', 'dull', 'miserable', 'stunned', 'pay', 'selfish', 'forgotten', 'devastating', 'missed', 'attack', 'suspected', 'died', 'quaking', 'devastating']}}"

Do not believe propaganda they tell you lies here,” the sign reads. “Russians against war.”\n    \n\n    \n            Channel One’s content is tightly controlled by the Russian government. President Vladimir Putin earlier this month signed a censorship bill that criminalizes “fake” information about the invasion of Ukraine, with a penalty of up to 15 years in prison for anyone convicted, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n    \n\n    \n            The Kremlin on Tuesday described Ovsyannikova’s actions as “hooliganism,” a criminal offense in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            “The channel and those who are in charge are dealing with it,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Friends of Ovsyannikova told OVD-Info, an independent human rights protest-monitoring group, she was at the Ostankino Police Department in Moscow, but her lawyer says he still does not know her whereabouts.\n    \n\n    \n            Dmitry Zakhvatov told CNN Tuesday he has been trying to locate her since her protest. Zakhvatov confirmed to CNN that Ovsyannikova is the woman seen on air holding the sign and that she is an editor for the channel. \n    \n\n    \n            “We didn’t find her for now, but we are continuing to search,” Zakhvatov said.\n    \n\n    \n            Russian state news agency Tass reported that law enforcement officials had begun a preliminary investigation into the “public dissemination of deliberately false information about the use of the Russian Armed Forces.”\n    \n\n    \n            The act of protest came nearly three weeks after Russia invaded neighboring Ukraine, setting off a humanitarian disaster in the country and triggering the greatest security crisis in Europe since the Cold War. \n    \n\n    \n            Satellite images show widespread destruction from Russian bombings across Ukraine, including the major cities of Kyiv and Mariupol. More than 2,500 civilians have died in Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials estimate. More than 2.8 million residents have fled the country since the invasion began, according to United Nations refugee estimates. \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    American in Moscow reveals how Russians reacted to protester on state TV\n                \n                    \n                                00:56\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n    \n            OVD-Info also obtained a video purportedly made by Ovsyannikova before she interrupted the news broadcast.\n    \n\n    \n            “What is happening now in Ukraine is a crime, and Russia is the aggressor country, and the responsibility for this aggression lies on the conscience of only one person.

But it’s coming under huge pressure from developed countries to abandon fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy in order to help save the climate.\n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria is not the only country confronting this dilemma. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, developing economies across Africa, Asia and Latin America are facing increasing pressure to cut carbon emissions at the very moment they are industrializing, a process that powered the advance of the West and lifted billions of people out of poverty.\n    \n\n    \n            At the same time, many poor countries that have so far contributed very little to global CO2 emissions are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and increased droughts, fires and floods linked to climate change, which threaten food security and exacerbate water scarcity. \n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria’s largest city Lagos, for example, may become uninhabitable by the end of this century if sea levels continue rising, according to scientific projections. It is already grappling with an eroding coastline that makes the city vulnerable to flooding. \n    \n\n    \n            Yet the average person in Nigeria emits less than 0.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the World Bank. That compares with the European Union’s 6.4 metric tons per capita and North America’s 15.3 metric tons.  \n    \n\n    \n            “The biggest justice issue is that the countries that are the least developed are also the most vulnerable and have the least ability to adapt to climate impacts,” said Amal-Lee Amin, climate change director at CDC Group, Britain’s development finance institution.\n    \n\n    \n            If poor countries are asked to give up fossil fuel production, experts say their wealthy counterparts need to spend trillions of dollars to develop solutions that both spur economic development and protect the planet. If that doesn’t happen, the global poor may be left behind in the energy transition.\n    \n\n    \n            Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2060 on Tuesday, joining other large energy exporters including Saudi Arabia. But he also told COP26 attendees that Nigeria needs “adequate and sustained technical and financial support” to meet its goal.\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Millions of Nigerians don’t have access to electricity. But the country’s government and economy depend on energy.\n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer, with fossil fuels accounting for 60% of government revenue and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The Petroleum Industry Act, which Buhari signed into law in August, envisions an even greater role for oil and gas in Nigeria’s economy.\n    \n\n    \n            “The intent [of the Act] is to really transform the industry for us to be able to attract the required investment into oil and gas,” explained Adewale Ajayi, a partner at KPMG in Lagos. That entails ramping up oil production to 4 million barrels per day, from 1.6 million barrels currently, and drawing on the country’s roughly 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves to provide much needed electricity. \n    \n\n    \n            “We have enormous reserves of gas in Nigeria and we need to be able to tap into those resources to develop the Nigerian economy,” Ajayi told CNN Business, adding that alongside power generation, gas will also be crucial to developing industries such as petrochemicals and fertilizers.\n    \n\n    \n            The law also lays the groundwork for developing oil refining capacity, which would allow Nigeria to stop importing virtually all of its fuel at an enormous cost.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Change can’t come quickly enough in a country where some 90 million people, or more than 40% of the population, don’t have access to electricity and more than 80 million live on less than $1 a day. \n    \n\n    \n            “Nigeria will soon, certainly before 2050, have a larger population than the United States, but it has less than 1% of America’s electricity generation capacity,” said Todd Moss, executive director of the Energy for Growth Hub, a nonprofit focused on energy for development based in Washington D.C. \n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria’s installed power generation capacity is about 13 gigawatts, but only about 4 or 5 gigawatts reaches end users due to breakdowns in transmission and distribution. By comparison, the United States has over 1,000 gigawatts of utliity-scale electricity generating capacity.\n    \n\n    \n            “Nigeria just needs a lot more energy,” added Moss. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Nigeria’s energy ambitions are coming up against a global drive by banks, pension funds and development finance institutions to limit or altogether halt investments into fossil fuels in line with net-zero emissions goals.\n    \n\n    \n            “They’re prioritizing global emissions over Africa’s development needs,” said Moss. \n    \n\n    \n            Across Sub-Saharan Africa, natural gas projects are “increasingly imperiled by a lack of development finance,” according to Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n    \n\n    \n            “Efforts to restrict fossil fuel investments in Africa are even harder to stomach because many of the wealthy countries behind them — including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States — include natural gas in their own multidecade plans to transition to clean energy,” Osinbajo wrote recently in Foreign Affairs.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            The European Investment Bank will end financing for fossil fuel energy projects from the end of this year, with some exceptions for gas-fired power plants, while the World Bank, the biggest provider of climate finance to developing countries, is moving towards restricting its fossil fuel investments, according to Reuters.\n    \n\n    \n            CDC Group will no longer invest in most parts of the coal, oil and gas industries, according to its recent fossil fuel policy. CDC will consider investments into gas power where there are “large unmet energy needs” and if these are consistent with a pathway to net zero, according to Amin.\n    \n\n    \n            Moves by such institutions to restrict fossil fuel funding come despite the fact that the United Kingdom relies on gas for around two thirds of its electricity, while the European Union currently has €87 billion ($102 billion) worth of gas projects in the pipeline, according to a report by the Global Energy Monitor. \n    \n\n    \n            In the United States, natural gas makes up 40% of utility-scale electricity generation, with coal, nuclear and renewables contributing about 20% each, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Like the United States, Europe and Britain, Nigeria sees a prominent role for renewable energy, notwithstanding its investments into gas power. \n    \n\n    \n            The government is targeting 32 gigawatts of on-grid power generation capacity by 2030, with renewables expected to contribute 43% and gas making up 41%. When off-grid capacity is included, gas and renewables will contribute roughly 30% each to planned power generation capacity of 45 gigawatts. \n    \n\n    \n            “In Nigeria, clean energy is central to our government’s plan to transition to net-zero emissions,” Osinbajo, the vice president, continued. “But our citizens cannot be forced to wait for battery prices to fall or new technologies to be created in order to have reliable energy and live modern, dignified lives.”\n    \n\n    \n            Sub-Saharan Africa is home to three quarters of the 760 million people globally without access to electricity, according to the World Bank, which expects that number to rise as a result of the pandemic. Less than half of the population has access to electricity in their homes.\n    \n\n    \n            In Nigeria, energy poverty is itself a major driver of emissions, according to Olu Verheijen, the founder of Lagos-based energy advisory business Latimer Energy. Given how scarce and unreliable existing supply is, many households and businesses rely on diesel generators for backup energy supply, while the lack of access to modern cooking technologies is a major driver of deforestation.\n    \n\n    \n            “If you’re siting on massive reserves of gas that have already been commercialized, it makes sense to extend that existing infrastructure to satisfy energy needs, diversify the economy and lift citizens out of poverty,” Verheijen said.\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The Nigerian government’s Solar Power Naija initiative — which aims to deploy 5 million new solar-based connections by 2023 — highlights how difficult it is to scale renewable solutions quickly. \n    \n\n    \n            The program will expand energy access to 25 million individuals, delivering power to just 28% of Nigerians who don’t currently have access. And while a step in the right direction, solar panels on roofs are not necessarily adequate to power large industrial businesses, which require a great deal more electricity than what’s needed to switch on a light bulb or charge a cellphone.\n    \n\n    \n            Still, renewable technology is developing at lightning speed and this can only benefit Africa. \n    \n\n    \n            Mark Carrato, who coordinates the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Power Africa program, sees vast potential to deliver electricity to Africa in a climate smart way. \n    \n\n    \n            Since its launch in 2013, Power Africa has delivered electricity to over 118 million people on the continent, connecting 25 million homes and businesses to on and off-grid energy solutions. More than three quarters of the transactions it has closed are based on renewable technologies.\n    \n\n    \n            “In almost every case, project by project you see a renewables solution that is cheaper,” he told CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            Carrato argues that fossil fuels might provide short-term solutions to energy needs, but could end up taxing poorer countries in the long run through increased funding costs and the problem of “stranded assets,” in which infrastructure becomes obsolete as it is replaced by cleaner and cheaper renewable technologies.\n    \n\n    \n            “The cost of capital to do fossil fuels is only going to increase,” Carrato said.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            On the other hand, the cost of renewable technologies is rapidly declining. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, the cost of large, utility-scale solar projects decreased 82% between 2010 and 2019, while the cost of onshore wind fell by 40%. \n    \n\n    \n            The cost of electricity storage technologies — which will be crucial to facilitating “deep decarbonization” including in sectors such as transport and construction — are also expected to fall considerably by 2030.\n    \n\n    \n            Africa is well positioned to benefit. The continent’s estimated potential to generate renewable energy from existing technologies is 1,000 times larger than its projected demand for electricity in 2040, according to IRENA.\n    \n\n    \n            “Renewable energy — including green hydrogen — could replace African exports of coal, oil and gas,” it said in a recent report with German development banks KfW and GIZ.\n    \n\n    \n            But to leverage the potential for renewables, average annual investments in Africa’s energy system must double by 2030 to approximately $65 billion.\n    \n\n    \n            While there’s good reason to be bullish on Africa’s potential to leapfrog fossil fuel technologies in favor of cleaner energy sources, the kind of renewable technology that can rapidly drive industrial development — to power factories, fuel transport and logistics networks and enable the digital economy to thrive — is not yet commercially available at scale. \n    \n\n    \n            In the meantime, some analysts argue that Africa needs reliable and affordable energy. “It’s absolutely untenable to hold the position that African countries and African people should wait until [battery] storage costs come down.

secured a fifth consecutive win in the Premier League.\n    </p>\n\n                </div></div>', 'text': '\n                    \n      \n      CNN\n        \xa0—\xa0\n    \n\n\n    \n            After one of the most tumultuous weeks in the history of the club, the drama continued for Chelsea on their return home Sunday.\n    \n\n    \n            Kai Havertz scored a sublime winner moments from time to steal a 1-0 victory against a valiant Newcastle United side on the Blues’ first game at Stamford Bridge since owner Roman Abramovich – who had been looking to sell the club – was sanctioned by the UK government.\n    \n\n    \n            The Russian oligarch’s sanctioning held a number of massive implications for Chelsea, which was allowed to continue playing under a special license but unable to buy or sell players, issue new contracts to existing players, sell new tickets to upcoming games or sell any club merchandise.\n    \n\n    \n            As rumors continue to swirl of prospective new owners, uncertainty reigns with supporters arriving at Stamford Bridge under the most unusual of pre-match circumstances.\n    \n\n    \n            Abramovich remains a figure of gratitude for many supporters at the club – his ownership overseeing an unprecedented era of success, including two UEFA Champions League titles – with his name chanted by fans during the team’s previous two away league matches.\n    \n\n    \n            On a stand in one corner of the ground, a banner featuring Abramovich’s face on the Russian flag with the words, “The Roman Empire,” remained visible throughout the match.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            However, a display which had been planned for Abramovich by supporters group We Are the Shed did not go ahead.\n    \n\n    \n            One of the group’s founders, Richard Weekes, had told CNN last week that they were planning a display to be shown before kick-off, but ahead of the game, the group said they would be pausing any such plans while circumstances are “constantly changing.”\n    \n\n    \n            “For the time being we are holding off with any type of displays since the current situation is constantly changing,” the tweet read.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Ahead of kick-off, Chelsea technical performance advisor Petr Cech said that the club was taking it “day by day.”\n    \n\n    \n            “We hope the situation will be clearer soon,” Cech, former goalkeeper with the club, told Sky Sports.\n    \n\n    \n            “We hope people working for the club will be able to get their salaries. It’s a day-to-day situation … without answers, it is difficult to plan.\n    \n\n    \n            “We go day by day and we hope the new owner will come and want to continue the legacy on the pitch because we are a team that wants to win and do our best,” Cech added.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The tumultuous context around the club’s ownership was made all the more intriguing by the circumstances of the opposition, Newcastle United, who in October were taken over by a Saudi-Arabian backed consortium.\n    \n\n    \n            The three-party consortium includes the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund (PIF), a sovereign wealth fund chaired by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n    \n\n    \n            Its involvement in the takeover of Newcastle has been a long-running saga in English football, during which time Saudi Arabia’s human rights record – including the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi – has come under scrutiny.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Saudi Arabia executed 81 men on Saturday, authorities said, in the biggest mass execution in decades, according to Reuters.\n    \n\n    \n            A Saudi Arabia flag – as well as a Ukrainian flag – was visible in the Newcastle supporters’ away end. \n    \n\n    \n            Asked about the executions after the game, Newcastle manager Eddie Howe told reporters he would “stick to the football.”\n    \n\n    \n            “I’m still bitterly disappointed about the result,” Howe added.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Much of his disappointment stemmed from Havertz’s role as matchwinner, with Howe alleging that the German should not have been on the pitch to score his late decider.\n    \n\n    \n            Havertz was booked for an elbow on Newcastle defender Dan Burn during the first-half, with the video assistant referee (VAR) not deeming it serious enough to be a red card.\n    \n\n    \n            Having frustrated the hosts for the majority of the game, more perceived injustice followed for Newcastle in the second-half when Chelsea’s Trevoh Chalobah looked to have fouled Jacob Murphy in the box, yet no penalty was given.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “Dan [Burn] thinks it’s a clear red,” Howe told reporters. “It could’ve been given. \n    \n\n    \n            “The one I’m most disappointed with and don’t understand how it’s not been given is the penalty … Jacob Murphy’s had his shirt ripped off his back near enough.”\n    \n\n    \n            It is said that football is often a cruel mistress, and for Newcastle, she stayed true to script as Havertz – moments from the end of regulation time – plucked Jorginho’s superb pass out of the sky with a deft touch before poking past Magpies keeper Martin Dubravka.\n    \n\n    \n            Cue delirium at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea, despite all the noise, secured a fifth consecutive win in the Premier League.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 5289, 'description': 'After one of

Beginning with 4x4s, the company’s reach has since expanded into public transport with bus conversions. Meanwhile, its electric motorbikes, designed and manufactured in Kenya, have attracted the attention of the world’s most famous ride-hailing app.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Opibus has roots as research by Linköping University students Filip Gardler, Mikael Gånge and Filip Lövström, whose project involved identifying places where electric mobility could have the largest possible impact. They pinpointed Kenya and established Opibus in 2017, starting their business by converting safari touring vehicles.\n    \n\n    \n            “We’ve always known the commercial potential (of electric conversion),” CEO Lövström says, adding it was easy to convince safari tour operators of the benefits of silent 4x4s that are driven on circular routes and return to the same recharging point.\n    \n\n    \n            Since then, Opibus has converted 4x4s for use in mining and other utility roles. The process is not cheap: prices start at just under $40,000 to convert a Toyota Land Cruiser and Land Rover, a 10-to-14-day process involving parts sourced from all over the world, says Lövström. But, he argues, the benefits outweigh the expense, and that much of the cost – along with the carbon footprint of the conversion – are recouped in the running of the electric vehicle (EV).\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Kenya, East Africa’s largest economy and a country where over 90% of domestically-produced electricity comes from renewable sources, presents a strong platform for clean electric mobility. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Fransua Vytautas Razvadauskas, mobility and cities senior consultant at market research company Euromonitor International, cites high prices as a barrier to entry, but so too infrastructure. “For the EV rollout to be successful (in Kenya), a large supply of charging units – both public and private – are needed to prevent range anxiety. This will, in turn, demand large investments in the upgrade of electricity distribution units, at homes and businesses,” he explains.\n    \n\n    \n            Using electric vehicles for public transport overcomes range anxiety and charging infrastructure issues to a degree. A bus operator knows how many miles it will travel in a day, what route and where it will stop, and charging units can be planned accordingly. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            In January, Opibus began an electric bus pilot in Nairobi, installing off-grid solar power stations to charge its batteries (the company sells a range of off-grid solar modules and batteries – a clean energy source but also indicative of Kenya’s history of blackouts). The 51-passenger vehicle hasn’t been tested commercially yet, but the company plans to do so later this year.\n    \n\n    \n            Lövström believes that with a fast-growing population in sub-Saharan Africa and rapidly expanding cities, buses will be a vital part of the region’s infrastructure. “We really think that electric buses are a huge part of how to create this transition to electric vehicles, and how to reduce emissions on both a city and global level,” he says.\n    \n\n    \n            Opibus plans to manufacture the bus for a Pan-African market in 2023. It also has competition. Another Kenya-based startup, BasiGo, has announced it plans to start its own electric bus pilot program in March.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Razvadauskas identifies the “largest opportunity” for EVs in East Africa as two- and three-wheeled vehicles, because they are cheaper and more popular than cars.\n    \n\n    \n            “In 2021, Kenya was home to 1.8 million motorcycles and mopeds compared with 1.2 million passenger cars – a tendency that is analogous in other regional countries such as Tanzania, Rwanda and Uganda,” Razvadauskas says.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Opibus is looking to corner the market through its Kenya-made electric motorbike.\n    \n\n    \n            The company decided to design its model from scratch because no existing motorcycles matched local users’ needs, says Lövström. “We need something that is very strong, very versatile, very robust, easy to repair and cheap at the same time,” he explains.\n    \n\n    \n            “Almost 90% of the motorcycles are built and designed locally,” says Lucy Mugala, a research and development engineer who helped create the motorbike. “(Electric vehicle manufacturing) is quite new in this county, so we are sort of pioneers.” \n    \n\n    \n            She says the motorcycle has evolved from having a single onboard battery to two removable batteries, which use a portable charger that can plug into any socket. In the near future, Mugala says docking stations packed with charged batteries could be a feature in cities, like today’s petrol stations.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Prices start at $1,400 for the motorcycle, which has a range of up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) and a top speed of 90 kilometers per hour (56 miles per hour). It enters a competitive market dominated by petrol motorcycles from Indian and Chinese manufacturers including Bajaj Auto and Haojun.

payout on Monday after winning the Players Championship. \n    \n\n    \n            The 28-year-old finished a shot ahead of Anirban Lahiri at TPC Sawgrass, going home with the winner’s check of $3.6 million.\n    \n\n    \n            Smith carded a six-under 66 to finish 13-under for the tournament and claim his second title of the season and fifth of his career. \n    \n\n    \n            When asked what he was going to do with such a large amount of money in the press conference afterwards, Smith hadn’t yet made up his mind. \n    \n\n    \n            “I really don’t – I don’t have an

My main priority really was just to hang out with them and golf was second for these few weeks.\n    \n\n    \n            “It’s nice to see them and nice to get a win for them.”\n    \n\n    \n            The tournament – one of the PGA Tour’s marquee events – was severely delayed due to inclement weather, with rain, darkness and lightning meaning it had to be finished on Monday rather the traditional Sunday final day. \n    \n\n    \n            When play resumed early on Monday morning, all 71 players left in the field had to complete their third rounds.\n    \n\n    \n            And after a quick turnaround, Smith began his final round strongly with a huge 38-foot birdie putt on the first hole. \n    \n\n    \n            He registered five birdies in his opening six holes, before three consecutive bogeys from the seventh hole weakened his grip on the lead. \n    \n\n    \n            But, under huge pressure, Smith reestablished his lead with four straight birdies to start the back nine, giving him a three-shot lead heading into the final hole. \n    \n\n    \n            Lahiri birdied the 17th behind Smith to cut the lead to two, while on the 18th, Smith hit his ball into the water as it looked like the title might be slipping away. \n    \n\n    \n            However, he managed to salvage bogey, leaving Lahiri needing a birdie to force a playoff, but the Indian golfer could only manage a par, cementing Smith’s victory. \n    \n\n    \n            The victory meant he became the fifth Australian to win the famous event, moving Smith up to sixth in golf’s world rankings. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “I felt as though one of these big ones was the next step for me,” Smith said. “I’ve knocked on the door a few times and I just felt like it was my time.\n    \n\n    \n            When asked about joining his countrymen in winning the tournament, Smith said: “Obviously, lots of Australians have won here, lots of great Australian golfers have won here, but the best that have ever lived have won here, as well.\n    \n\n    \n            “So it’s pretty cool to have the name on the same trophy as them.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 3440, 'description': 'Cameron Smith claimed the PGA Tour’s biggest payout on Monday after winning the Players Championship.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220315054335-02-the-players-championship-cameron-smith.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-15T10:41:01Z', 'keywords': ['golf', ' golf events', ' pga tour', ' sports and recreation', ' sports events', ' sports organizations and teams', ' the players championship'], 'summary': ['The win held even more significance for Smith given who was within the crowd.', 'Smith, who lives in Florida, explained that “golf was second for these few weeks.”', '“It’s really cool to have them here.', '“It’s nice to see them and nice to get a win for them.”', '“I felt as though one of these big ones was the next step for me,” Smith said.', '“So it’s pretty cool to have the name on the same trophy as them.”'], 'sentiment': {'score': 58, 'comparative': 0.11196911196911197, 'calculation': [{'cool': 1}, {'pretty': 1}, {'won': 3}, {'best': 3}, {'won': 3}, {'great': 3}, {'won': 3}, {'winning': 4}, {'like': 2}, {'big': 1}, {'famous': 2}, {'win': 4}, {'victory': 3}, {'victory': 3}, {'like': 2}, {'cut': -1}, {'straight': 1}, {'pressure': -1}, {'huge': 1}, {'weakened': -2}, {'huge': 1}, {'darkness': -1}, {'delayed': -1}, {'severely': -2}, {'win': 4}, {'nice': 3}, {'nice': 3}, {'cool': 1}, {'victory': 3}, {'significance': 1}, {'win': 4}, {'smile': 2}, {'winning': 4}], 'postive': ['cool', 'pretty', 'won', 'best', 'won', 'great', 'won', 'winning', 'like', 'big', 'famous', 'win', 'victory', 'victory', 'like', 'straight', 'huge', 'huge', 'win', 'nice', 'nice', 'cool', 'victory', 'significance', 'win', 'smile', 'winning'], 'negative': ['cut', 'pressure', 'weakened', 'darkness', 'delayed', 'severely']}}"

I just enjoyed climbing.” \n    \n\n    \n            After a couple of years of practice and hard work, Garnbret quickly emerged as one of the best climbers in her country. \n    \n\n    \n            Her world-class ability then became evident as she entered international competitions and started winning them consistently. \n    \n\n    \n            She has gone on to win multiple World Cup events and has her eyes firmly on the postponed Tokyo Games which are set to finally go ahead this summer, which will see sport climbing make its Olympic debut. \n    \n\n    \n            READ: Trailblazing climber Sasha DiGiulian was told ‘little girls don’t belong.’ \n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The 22-year-old says the initial postponement gave her more time to work on her weaknesses but admitted the uncertainty around the pandemic was difficult to get her head around. \n    \n\n    \n            She was fortunate enough to have a climbing wall at home, which she used to keep in good shape during her country’s lockdown, but she was tested in ways she hadn’t expected. \n    \n\n    \n            “I could train, but for me, it was hard because I was always the motivated person. I always had small goals and, of course, big goals and I never had fluctuations in motivation,” she says.\n    \n\n    \n            “I was always motivated but now it happened to me that I was motivated some days for training, some days not because every competition was postponed. I didn’t know myself like that.\n    \n\n    \n            “It was just something different and I learned a lot about myself, but I got used to the situation quite quickly.”\n    \n\n    \n            Organizers remain insistent that the Games will go ahead this year, but there is still an element of doubt that the pandemic could scupper plans once again. \n    \n\n    \n            Garnbret is trying to stay positive and is optimistic she’ll make her Olympic debut in 2021, despite the situation seemingly changing every week.\n    \n\n    \n            “I think Covid last year was just, of course, something new for us and we didn’t know what to expect, how to deal with it,” she adds.\n    \n\n    \n            “But we came prepared into this year with all safety precautions and everything. It’s still not a hundred percent, I completely understand that, but I will do my best and I will keep preparing for the Olympics.”\n    \n\n\n    \n            READ: The climbers aiming to boost diversity in the sport\n    \n\n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    Climbing Europe's tallest chimney\n                \n                    \n                                02:59\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Should sport climbing make its debut at this year’s Olympics, the competition will be run across three disciplines, each with their own techniques and format.\n    \n\n    \n            Bouldering involves navigating as many fixed routes as possible in four minutes on a four-meter high wall with no safety ropes. Lead climbing requires athletes to climb as high as possible on a 15-meter plus wall in six minutes using safety ropes, without reclimbs. Speed climbing has two climbers ascend a parallel route at the same time on a 15-meter wall set at 95 degrees – sometimes doing so in under 8 seconds. Combined results will determine medalists.\n    \n\n    \n            Garnbret says speed climbing is by far her weakest discipline but has a thorough training schedule in place to improve every aspect of her performance. \n    \n\n    \n            She trains six days a week, splitting her time between gym work, speed climbing and her usual wall training. Due to a lack of centralized facilities in Slovenia, Garnbret often drives up to four hours a day to attend all her sessions. \n    \n\n    \n            It’s a regime that requires determination, passion and a tireless work ethic but winning a gold medal would make it all worthwhile. \n    \n\n    \n            “I definitely know that every girl will take that extra year to their benefit,” she says. “I know every girl has her eyes set on the gold.”\n    \n\n    \n            “I can’t say that I will win the gold because I know everyone will be 100% prepared for that. \n    \n\n    \n            “I will definitely keep training and I will be prepared as much as possible when the time comes and then we will see what will happen. But, definitely, I’m looking forward to it.” \n    \n\n\n    \n            READ: Emily Harrington on her historic El Capitan climb\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            While other athletes will be backed by wealthy sponsors and a team of sport scientists at this year’s Olympics, Garnbret knows climbing is not quite at that level.\n    \n\n    \n            The Slovenian hopes the opportunity to compete in front of a global audience will go some way towards changing that. \n    \n\n    \n            “I think it will be really beneficial to climbing because climbing is still a young sport. It’s super young,” she says. \n    \n\n    \n            “So it’s definitely a huge playground for everyone, for sponsors, for some non-endemic sponsors that are still yet to come into our sport. That’s definitely something huge.” \n    \n\n    \n            Due to her success, Garnbret is already a role model to young climbers across the world, and she hopes she can drive the charge for better facilities in her own country. \n    \n\n    \n            She also wants to boost a healthy image of the sport, which she says is more important than anything.\n    \n\n    \n            Garnbret says the demands of climbing have led to youngsters, especially girls, trying to get lighter. This has, she says, sometimes led to people developing eating disorders in the bid for better results. \n    \n\n    \n            She now wants to use her platform to show the next generation of climbers that maintaining a healthy lifestyle can translate into success.\n    \n\n    \n            “I just want to set a good example in that you don’t need to lose extra weight to be successful,” she says. \n    \n\n    \n            “I definitely feel responsible for our sport. I just want to represent climbing as a fun sport, that it’s always fun, you have to just climb up and enjoy yourself.” \n    \n\n    \n            She continues: “I remember I fell in love […] the first time that I tried climbing because it felt so weightless, and it was just me and the wall.

In 2010, the Nigerian executive became the first African general manager in US professional sports when he joined the NBA’s Denver Nuggets. When he became the president of the Toronto Raptors in 2013, that was another milestone.\n    \n\n    \n            And in 2019 he led the Canadian basketball team to become the first outside of the US to win an NBA championship. Yet during the on-court celebration, Ujiri had an altercation with a sheriff’s deputy that he believes happened because he is Black.\n    \n\n    \n            Ujiri, who signed a contract extension with the Raptors in August to make him both vice-chairman and president, says the incident has motivated him to lean in more to his humanitarian work – particularly through his Giants of Africa organization.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Through the nonprofit, he hopes to draw more Africans to the sport, hosting basketball camps for more than 5,000 boys and girls in 16 African countries since 2003 – and he is currently on a mission to build 100 basketball courts across the continent. \n    \n\n    \n            CNN’s Arit Okpo spoke to Ujiri in Kenya while he was unveiling some of the first courts this past September.  \n    \n\n    \n            The following interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n    \n\n    \n            Arit Okpo: You’re the first Black, non-American team president in North American sports. What does that mean to you?\n    \n\n    \n            Masai Ujiri: I struggle with it a little bit because you have the pride in you to say you are leading the way and that’s where it ends. Because if there are not other people that follow after me, that means I didn’t do a good job. I’m the only one, and I actually hate it. I want there to be more Blacks. I want there to be more Africans.\n    \n\n    \n            It’s very prideful for me to bring young African coaches, young African women to come and speak to these kids because they see that if me and you can do it, they can do it too. So yeah, I don’t want to be the only one. I hate that. It’s fine, being the first – I have a problem with being the only one.  \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    NBA executive makes full-court commitment to Africa\n                \n                    \n                                23:01\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n    \n            Okpo: So are there ways that you are taking this and maybe changing the way certain things are done?\n    \n\n    \n            Ujiri: Yes, plenty of ways. First of all, we have to give more Black people opportunity in our own institutions and organizations. We have to continue to figure out a way to be decision-makers, be in these boardrooms. It’s not only hire an intern or hire a diversity and inclusion officer – we have to be in positions where decisions are being made in the best way. For me personally, there are a couple of projects that we are working on that I cannot speak too much about now that I am 100% excited about. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Okpo: Your duties with the Toronto Raptors have expanded to vice-chairman. In addition to president, what does that mean in terms of the work that you’re going to be doing?\n    \n\n    \n            Ujiri: We are the only (NBA) team that’s outside the United States so that brings a unique opportunity. And some people don’t really understand it. When I spoke to ownership, I thought, you know what? We need to see it bigger. We need to be the team of the world. I have to help more people. I have to use my platform to be a voice.\n    \n\n    \n            It would be a failure if there are not more (people like) me in this position. So my voice had to be bigger, and put us in environments where we can be even bigger decision makers.

Too much exposure can lead to thyroid cancer. \n    \n\n    \n            When used as directed, potassium iodide in liquid or pill form can quickly saturate the thyroid gland and prevent it from absorbing radioactive iodine. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Large manufacturers of potassium iodide approved for sale in the United Sates have seen their inventories rapidly depleted in recent weeks, coinciding with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            As supplies in the market dry up, price gouging has set in.\n    \n\n    \n            On eBay\n            \n                (EBAY), four boxes of Thyrosafe potassium iodide tablets were listed for $132.50 on Monday. Another listing for a box of IOSAT 130 mg pills was selling for $89.95 each. The 14-pack box of the IOSAT tablets, made by Anbex, sell for $13.99 on the manufacturer’s website.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            It’s also important to know that potassium iodide pills aren’t a cure-all and don’t offer 100% protection against radioactive iodine. The CDC warns that a single dose protects the thyroid gland for just 24 hours.\n    \n\n    \n            The agency said taking a higher dose, or taking it more often than recommended, does not offer more protection and can cause severe illness or death.\n    \n\n    \n            The CDC also cautions that potassium iodide pills only protect the thyroid and work best for certain age groups.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Anbex, Inc., based in New York, is a leading supplier and produces 65 mg and 130 mg IOSAT potassium iodide tablets. Its website currently shows a message saying, “We are currently out of stock of IOSAT potassium iodide 130mg and 65mg tablets.”\n    \n\n    \n            “We hope to be back in stock in early April but we’re pushing for late March,” said Troy Jones, vice president of sales and marketing for Anbex. Jones also runs a website www.nukepills.com that sells Anbex’s potassium iodide pills.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Jones said the company saw a rush of orders beginning in mid February of up to 15 million tablets from a variety of buyers, including individuals, resellers, hospitals, municipalities and governments worldwide.\n    \n\n    \n            “The big run started on February 23 through February 28. We sold out of all the inventory we had,” Jones said. Although supplies are being replenished weekly, they’re selling out just as fast. “In the past five days we’ve probably sold as much as what typically would take us half a year to sell,” he added.\n    \n\n    \n            The timeline, Jones said, matched reports last month that Russian forces had seized control of Ukraine’s Chernobyl nuclear power plant. The plant’s electrical system was reportedly damaged during the attack and required repair work.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Historically, demand for potassium iodide spikes when there’s a real or perceived threat of nuclear fallout, Jones said.\n    \n\n    \n            Demand soared when former President Donald Trump tweeted in 2018 that he had a “much bigger & more powerful” button than North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, igniting fear about an escalating threat of nuclear war. It also happened in the same year when the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency sent out a false ballistic missile alert.\n    \n\n    \n            And just last month, Russian president Vladimir Putin said he had ordered his country’s deterrence forces — which include nuclear arms — to be at their highest state of alert. The White House responded to the move, calling it part of a wider pattern of unprovoked escalations and “manufactured threats” from the Kremlin. \n    \n\n    \n            The escalating rhetoric from Russia only helped fuel anxiety — and the purchase of potassium iodide, manufacturers said.\n    \n\n    \n            Anbex, which sells its tablets in a 14- day or 20-day foil-sealed pack depending on the dosage, has ramped up production, said Jones. \n    \n\n    \n            He said consumers should follow the CDC’s guidelines and only take potassium iodide pills on the advice of health officials.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            London-based BTG Specialty Pharmaceuticals said it’s also experiencing heightened demand for the company’s potassium iodide products across Europe and the US.  \n    \n\n    \n            “This has coincided with the conflict in Ukraine,” said Chris Sampson, spokesperson for London-based BTG, which also has US operations.

But the computer chip shortage is proving that adage wrong.\n    \n\n    \n            Ford\n            \n                (F) will begin shipping Explorer SUVs without all of its chips to address the tight inventory of vehicles available for sale at dealerships.\n    \n\n    \n            The automaker disclosed this weekend that it would build Explorers without rear-seat controls for the air conditioner and heat. The driver and front-seat passenger will still be able to adjust climate controls for backseat passengers — but people in the back won’t be able to change the temperature themselves.\n    \n\n    \n            “We’re doing this as a way to get our customers their vehicles sooner,” said Ford spokesperson Said Deep. \n    \n\n    \n            He said Ford had already offered buyers of its best-selling F-150 pickup a choice: They could give up a fuel-saving feature called “start-stop” and get a $50 credit — or they could wait for the truck to be built with the feature. Start-stop automatically turns the engine off when the truck comes to a complete stop, and restarts it when the driver takes his or her foot off the brake.\n    \n\n    \n            The start-stop option is only available at the time an F-150 is built, and cannot be added after the fact. But Deep said Ford will be able to install the rear-seat climate control feature on Explorers shipped without the feature once the chips become available. It will be added at dealerships at no cost to the owners.\n    \n\n    \n            Virtually all automakers have been forced to temporarily shut production at some of their factories over the last year and a half due to the lack of computer chips and, in some cases, other parts. The reduced inventories of new vehicles for sale have lifted car prices to record levels — a major factor in America’s highest rate of inflation in nearly 40 years.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Ford is not the only automaker shipping vehicles without all the features they were designed to include. \n    \n\n    \n            Last year General Motors was forced to temporarily stop offering several features, including a fuel management module designed to improve mileage in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups by about one mile per gallon. GM also stopped offering a stop-start feature on some of its heavy-duty pickups.\n    \n\n    \n            GM\n            \n                (GM) also had to exclude some comfort features, such as heated and cooled seats in a variety of models, the adjustable lumbar support in the Cadillac XT4, as well as parking assist features. But GM\n            \n                (GM) also expects it will be able to offer a free retrofit for those features once the chips become available.\n    \n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n"", 'length': 11197, 'description': 'The auto industry has a saying: You can’t build a car with 99% of the parts.

All businesses — apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong — have suspended operations or have implemented work-from-home policies. The city is home to Chinese tech giants Huawei and Tencent.\n    \n\n    \n            Apart from Shenzhen, local authorities in the northeastern province of Jilin have banned residents from leaving or traveling since Monday. The province, with 24 million people, is home to the industrial hub of Changchun, where Toyota\n            \n                (TM) and Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF) run their car factories in partnership with state-owned car maker FAW Group.\n    \n\n    \n            Shanghai, the country’s largest business center, has also imposed stringent measures after a spike in Covid cases, closing schools and cinemas and restricting travel into the city.\n    \n\n    \n            “Indeed, Covid-19 is the biggest uncertainty this year,” Hu from Macquarie Group said.\n    \n\n    \n            He predicts that China will grow at 4% in the current quarter. For 2022, he expects the world’s second largest economy to grow at 5%, lower than the government’s target. \n    \n\n    \n            Earlier this month, Premier Li set China’s economic growth target at around 5.5% for 2022, the lowest official goal in decades.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            China growth may be hit even further by the war in Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            Russia’s invasion of its neighbor is pushing up commodity prices and roiling the global economy, at a time when policymakers are already racing to get high inflation under control. \n    \n\n    \n            Fu from the NBS said the direct impact of the tensions in Europe on China is “limited,” as its trade exposure to Russia and Ukraine is “small.”\n    \n\n    \n            But he said the impact on global commodity prices is “obvious,” which could increase the pressure of “imported inflation” on China.\n    \n\n    \n            Several food and beverage companies in China have recently hiked prices of their products, including dairy giants Yili and Mengniu.\n    \n\n    \n            “The recent acceleration in commodity prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict has exacerbated the margin pressure on packaged food companies,” analysts from Morningstar wrote in a report on Tuesday. “Various food and beverage companies in China have engaged in price hikes since the third quarter last year to mitigate margin compression.” \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            China and Russia have forged close ties in recent years, and signed a number of commodities deals during Russian President Putin’s visit to Beijing last month. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has put their friendship to the test. \n    \n\n    \n            Beijing has not rushed to help Russia after the latter’s economy was slammed by sanctions from all over the world. The complicated messaging from Beijing suggests Chinese leaders are walking “a very difficult tightrope” on Ukraine, analysts say.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 6660, 'description': 'China’s economy started the year on a bright note, with several major indicators beating forecasts.

In 2010, the Nigerian executive became the first African general manager in US professional sports when he joined the NBA’s Denver Nuggets. When he became the president of the Toronto Raptors in 2013, that was another milestone.\n    \n\n    \n            And in 2019 he led the Canadian basketball team to become the first outside of the US to win an NBA championship. Yet during the on-court celebration, Ujiri had an altercation with a sheriff’s deputy that he believes happened because he is Black.\n    \n\n    \n            Ujiri, who signed a contract extension with the Raptors in August to make him both vice-chairman and president, says the incident has motivated him to lean in more to his humanitarian work – particularly through his Giants of Africa organization.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Through the nonprofit, he hopes to draw more Africans to the sport, hosting basketball camps for more than 5,000 boys and girls in 16 African countries since 2003 – and he is currently on a mission to build 100 basketball courts across the continent. \n    \n\n    \n            CNN’s Arit Okpo spoke to Ujiri in Kenya while he was unveiling some of the first courts this past September.  \n    \n\n    \n            The following interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n    \n\n    \n            Arit Okpo: You’re the first Black, non-American team president in North American sports. What does that mean to you?\n    \n\n    \n            Masai Ujiri: I struggle with it a little bit because you have the pride in you to say you are leading the way and that’s where it ends. Because if there are not other people that follow after me, that means I didn’t do a good job. I’m the only one, and I actually hate it. I want there to be more Blacks. I want there to be more Africans.\n    \n\n    \n            It’s very prideful for me to bring young African coaches, young African women to come and speak to these kids because they see that if me and you can do it, they can do it too. So yeah, I don’t want to be the only one. I hate that. It’s fine, being the first – I have a problem with being the only one.  \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    NBA executive makes full-court commitment to Africa\n                \n                    \n                                23:01\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n    \n            Okpo: So are there ways that you are taking this and maybe changing the way certain things are done?\n    \n\n    \n            Ujiri: Yes, plenty of ways. First of all, we have to give more Black people opportunity in our own institutions and organizations. We have to continue to figure out a way to be decision-makers, be in these boardrooms. It’s not only hire an intern or hire a diversity and inclusion officer – we have to be in positions where decisions are being made in the best way. For me personally, there are a couple of projects that we are working on that I cannot speak too much about now that I am 100% excited about. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Okpo: Your duties with the Toronto Raptors have expanded to vice-chairman. In addition to president, what does that mean in terms of the work that you’re going to be doing?\n    \n\n    \n            Ujiri: We are the only (NBA) team that’s outside the United States so that brings a unique opportunity. And some people don’t really understand it. When I spoke to ownership, I thought, you know what? We need to see it bigger. We need to be the team of the world. I have to help more people. I have to use my platform to be a voice.\n    \n\n    \n            It would be a failure if there are not more (people like) me in this position. So my voice had to be bigger, and put us in environments where we can be even bigger decision makers.

But that does not change the minister’s moral obligation to take action on climate change and to protect young people from the harms that it will bring. It does not change the science,” the 17-year-old told reporters. “It does not put out the fires or drain the flood waters.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Our lawyers will be reviewing the judgment, and we will have more to say on possible next steps for the coming weeks, but what I can say today is that we will not stop in our fight for climate justice.”\n    \n\n    \n            Amanda McKenzie, the chief executive of the Climate Council said the ruling was disappointing but the children succeeded in drawing more attention to an important issue.\n    \n\n    \n            “You need a drumbeat, if you like, of information and people saying, ‘this is not okay.’ And I feel like the young people that pushed this case, they really created a moment to focus people’s attention on what climate change means for young Australians. And I think that was really valuable,” she said.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    Record-breaking floods hit eastern Australia\n                \n                    \n                                01:20\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN, Reuters\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n    \n            The children’s initial legal victory didn’t stop the government from approving the Whitehaven Vickery coal mine extension.

She works at Tesco\n            \n                (TSCDF), a supermarket chain, where she has seen “every single product” rise in price.\n    \n\n    \n            “Milk was 80p ($1.05). The smallest one, that’s gone to £1 ($1.31),” she said. “The bread — the cheapest bread that we used to do for £1 — has gone to £1.20 ($1.57).” \n    \n\n    \n            Annual consumer price inflation hit 5.5% in January in the United Kingdom — its highest level since 1992 — fueled by product shortages and a sharp spike in demand as pandemic lockdowns were lifted. Wages aren’t keeping pace.  \n    \n\n    \n            Average worker pay suffered its biggest drop in more than seven years in the three months to January, falling by 1% over the same period a year ago once inflation is taken into account, the UK Office for National Statistics said on Tuesday. And the war in Ukraine has driven energy costs even higher —  gasoline and diesel prices have soared to new record highs in recent days.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The Boiler House Youth and Community Space started its food pantry during the coronavirus pandemic. Unlike a traditional food bank, guests browse and shop for their own items, paying a £6.50 ($8.50) fee to receive about £35 ($46) worth of food and toiletries. \n    \n\n    \n            But the charity’s services have expanded to provide members with shoes and help paying their energy bills as many struggle with  the most severe knock to their purchasing power in years. \n    \n\n    \n            Davina Mathurin, project officer for The Boiler House, summarized the dilemma many are facing. \n    \n\n    \n            “Do you either keep the house warm so [your] children don’t get ill?” she said. “Or do [you] buy food so they can eat and they’re not hungry?”\n    \n\n    \n            Millions of people’s fuel bills rose in October when Britain’s energy regulator increased its consumer price cap — the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy — by 12% after a global natural gas supply crunch pushed wholesale prices up to record levels.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            On the day CNN Business visited in February, Mathurin had started referring some members to fuel voucher programs organized by charities that offer up to £49 ($64) to help with bills. Demand was high, she said.  \n    \n\n    \n            Monique John, another regular visitor to the Boiler House, told CNN Business that she owns a smart meter. The device helps her conserve energy, but her money does not stretch nearly as far as it used to.  \n    \n\n    \n            “You just literally watch [the meter] go down and down and down and down and down,” she said. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The worst is yet to come.\n    \n\n    \n            In April, the energy price cap will soar by 54% — its largest ever rise — burdening 22 million people with an annual bill of roughly £2,000 ($2,618). Inflation is also expected to peak above 7% and a new payroll tax to help fund health and social care will take effect. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The higher costs could push the number of “destitute” households — defined as those unable to afford basic necessities — up by a third to hit 1 million, according to analysis by The National Institute of Economic and Social Research. \n    \n\n    \n            Russia’s invasion of Ukraine last month pushed wholesale gas prices up even further as global markets panicked over whether sanctions would hit Russian exports. Analysts at investment bank Investec said Britons’ annual energy bills after October — the next time the price cap is adjusted — could rocket past £3,000 ($3,927) as a result. \n    \n\n    \n            “Now there’s just nothing left to give from people’s budgets. There’s no way the numbers add up now,” Lucy Bannister, policy campaigns manager at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, an anti-poverty charity, told CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            “Children are feeling too scared to ask for the heating to be put on,” she added. “They’re really kind of taking on that stress that they’re seeing their parents go through. Feeling hungry and not asking for a snack.”\n    \n\n    \n            The government will try to ease the pain by cutting local taxes and allowing millions of Britons to spread the cost of their energy bills over the next few years. \n    \n\n    \n            A government spokesperson told CNN Business that it was “providing support worth around £12 billion ($16 billion) this financial year and next, to help households with the cost of living.”\n    \n\n    \n            The spokesperson added that the government would raise the minimum wage by more than £1,000 ($1,309) a year and hike a benefit claimed by people on low incomes by the same amount. Both will start in April.\n    \n\n    \n            Critics say the government’s response is inadequate and fails to target those who need it most. \n    \n\n    \n            Ian Allinson, a member of the executive committee at Manchester Trades Union Council, which organized a protest against higher costs in February, said the situation is “alarming.” He said the government’s plan to delay energy payments won’t help vulnerable people.\n    \n\n    \n            “We’re appalled when the main measure the government has announced [to bring down energy bills] is that we have to give ourselves a loan,” he told CNN Business. \n    \n\n    \n            “A lot of people are struggling with debt already. The idea that there’s then enforced further debt rather than any genuine help is just shocking.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Angry Britons are taking to the streets. Protesters, and the opposition Labour Party, have called for a windfall tax on energy companies like BP\n            \n                (BP) and Shell\n            \n                (RDSA), which made billions in profit last year. \n    \n\n    \n            “It’s just scandalous that the government is choosing to not do something effective to support ordinary people but is happy to leave those mega profits for the companies that are inflicting this on us,” Allinson said. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            At a north London church, piles of groceries are laid out in a grid on the floor of a small side building. Volunteers are packing the donated items into bags before driving them to people’s doors. \n    \n\n    \n            Cooking Champions, an organization which caters for charitable groups and local businesses, started its delivery service in April 2020 after the pandemic hit. \n    \n\n    \n            Annalisa Moseley is one of the first to receive her shopping. The mother-of-two said that without Cooking Champions, some weeks she would have no food. Thinking about what will happen after April is stressful, she said.   \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “It’s all on my shoulders sort of thing to make sure the kids are warm and fed and everything,” Moseley said. “It has been getting me down a little bit, but just got to carry on. Keep trying.”\n    \n\n    \n            Moseley receives Universal Credit — a benefit for people who are out of work or on low incomes. The government hiked payments by £20 ($26) a week during the pandemic, but that ended in October 2021. The benefit will increase by 3.1% in April, but that’s less than half the expected rate of inflation.\n    \n\n    \n            Rising wages can’t keep up either. \n    \n\n    \n            The Spring Community Hub, a food and clothes bank 15 miles to the south across London, runs another door-to-door delivery service. Lately, volunteers have helped increasing numbers of younger and more affluent people. \n    \n\n    \n            “We’re seeing more working people and people on those precarious hours particularly,” CEO Felicia Boshorin told CNN Business. \n    \n\n    \n            “When the actual money comes, it’s not enough,” she added.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            September looms large for parents worried about the cost of school uniforms. Shirts, sweaters and jackets emblazoned with school logos — mandatory in the United Kingdom — can run into the hundreds of pounds for a single child.\n    \n\n    \n            One in 10 British families have fallen into debt buying items needed for school, according to a 2020 survey by The Children’s Society, a charity.

In 2013, he decided to create his own game while studying at the University of Calabar in southern Nigeria.\n    \n\n    \n            “There was a nationwide strike at government-owned universities in the country at the time, so nobody was going to class,” Ogbuagu, now 29, says. With nothing to do, “eventually, we started playing tabletop games.” \n    \n\n    \n            At the time, he was not sure how to create games, so he used cardboard, stones, and dice from an old Ludo game to make a dice rolling and card drafting game for him and his friends.\n    \n\n    \n            Many of Ogbuagu’s friends in school enjoyed playing the game, inspiring him to turn his passion into a profession. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            In 2016, a few years after making his first game, Ogbuagu founded a game production publishing company called NIBCARD, which focuses on tabletop games such as board and card games.\n    \n\n    \n            “I eventually learned to make games on YouTube,” he says. “I learned how to make boards. I learned about direct imaging printers. I also found stores where I could get material to make the games I wanted.”\n    \n\n    \n            That same year, he started an annual convention in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city, called the Africa Boardgame Convention, or “AbCon” – a gathering of tabletop game lovers from across the country, which Ogbuagu says is the first of its kind in West Africa. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “Many Nigerians hold stereotypes about board games. They say, ‘oh, it is a woman’s game.’ The convention exists to cancel those types of stereotypes,” Ogbuagu explains. Roughly 500 people attend the convention every year, he adds. \n    \n\n    \n            But his big break came in 2017 when charity organization Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) hired NIBCARD to create 2,300 copies of a game called “Luku Luku” for an education project it was running in the country.\n    \n\n    \n            Read more: African artists are banking on a record-breaking art market\n    \n\n    \n            Ogbuagu had been working with VSO as a volunteer when the group found out he was into games. “I met British colleagues who liked to play card games.

Unlike a fossil fuel power station, which can operate night and day, wind and solar power are intermittent, meaning that if a cloud blocks the sun or there’s a lull in the wind, electricity generation drops.\n    \n\n    \n            To compete with fossil fuels, you need to “make renewables predictable,” says Piconi, which means storing excess energy and being able to dispatch it when required. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            One solution to this problem is lithium-ion batteries, which are already linked up to power grids worldwide. They can be charged using electricity generated from wind and solar and release that energy on demand. \n    \n\n    \n            The technology has advanced rapidly in recent decades, says Dan Shreve, global head of energy storage at Wood Mackenzie, an energy research and consultancy firm. For the most part, they have been used for short-term energy storage (up to six hours), he says, and as decarbonization ramps up, demand for more durable storage will rise.\n    \n\n    \n            Another drawback is that lithium is a limited resource, found only in certain parts of the world, and mining it can harm the environment. While the cost of batteries has plummeted over the last decade, prices started to soar in 2021 as lithium demand outstripped supply. \n    \n\n    \n            For these reasons, Piconi says that while batteries are great for electric cars or computer electronics, they’re not “ideal for large utility-scale trade.” \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Instead, Energy Vault decided to base its technology on a method developed over 100 years ago, which is widely used to store renewable energy: pumped storage hydropower. During off-peak periods, a turbine pumps water from a reservoir on low ground to one on higher ground, and during periods of peak demand, the water is allowed to flow down through the turbine, generating electrical energy. \n    \n\n    \n            Piconi says Energy Vault relies on gravity in the same way, but “instead of using water, we’re using these composite blocks.” \n    \n\n    \n            By doing it this way, he says the company is not dependent on topography and doesn’t have to dig out reservoirs or create dams, which can have negative effects on the environment. \n    \n\n  \n    “Simple and elegant”\n\n\n    \n            Since Energy Vault established its successful prototype in Switzerland in 2020, the company has pivoted from the tower model design, which could reach up to 200 meters in height, to 20-story modular buildings it calls “Energy Vault Resiliency Centers.” Piconi says the company received feedback from potential clients that the tower was “too tall” and might not comply with international building codes.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            The resiliency centers will use the same bricks, made from soil and waste products, and the buildings will be around 100 meters tall. Bricks will move up and down inside the building on trolleys, controlled by an artificial intelligence system that identifies optimal times for charging or discharging energy, depending on supply and demand.\n    \n\n    \n            The centers will vary in footprint, possibly covering between 1.5 and 20 acres depending on the storage capacity, he adds. But they are likely to be installed in places where space isn’t an issue, such as near existing wind or solar plants. \n    \n\n    \n            Energy Vault’s technology is “simple and elegant,” says Shreve, but he questions whether the devices can compete with lithium-ion batteries on price. \n    \n\n    \n            Even so, the market is hungry for battery alternatives. While other startups — such as UK-based Gravitricity, which drops weights down disused mineshafts — are also exploring gravity-based energy storage, none yet match the scale of Energy Vault.\n    \n\n    \n            In February, Energy Vault listed on the New York stock exchange, raising approximately $235 million. It recently announced that actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio had joined the company’s strategic advisory board.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            This year, Energy Vault will start building resiliency centers for DG fuels, which wants a continuous supply of renewable energy to create green hydrogen fuel for the aviation industry. It has also signed deals worth up to $880 million with companies including Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil producer, metal smelting company Korea Zinc, and mining giant BHP. \n    \n\n    \n            With this backing, Piconi is confident Energy Vault can help to accelerate the energy transition.\n    \n\n    \n            So far, customers have signed up to projects that equate to 2.5 gigawatt hours of energy storage — a significant addition to the 17 gigawatt hours of battery storage that Wood Mackenzie estimates is currently in operation in the United States. “In terms of impact, that’s pretty massive,” says Piconi. \n    \n\n                ', 'length': 6212, 'description': 'Energy Vault’s gravity-based technology can store wind and solar power longer than batteries.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220308104051-energy-vault-01.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-14T09:52:11Z', 'keywords': ['business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' electric power industry', ' energy and utilities', ' environment and natural resources', ' environmentalism', ' renewable energy', ' utilities industry'], 'summary': ['Six arms protrude from the top, hoisting giant blocks into the sky.', 'But these aren’t building blocks, and the crane isn’t being used for construction.', 'When power demand rises, the bricks are lowered, releasing kinetic energy back to the grid.', 'It might sound like a school science project, but this form of energy storage could be vital as the world transitions to clean energy.', 'Piconi says Energy Vault relies on gravity in the same way, but “instead of using water, we’re using these composite blocks.”', 'Even so, the market is hungry for battery alternatives.', '“In terms of impact, that’s pretty massive,” says Piconi.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 13, 'comparative': 0.014492753623188406, 'calculation': [{'pretty': 1}, {'united': 1}, {'significant': 1}, {'help': 2}, {'confident': 2}, {'backing': 2}, {'worth': 2}, {'elegant': 2}, {'demand': -1}, {'waste': -1}, {'reach': 1}, {'successful': 3}, {'negative': -2}, {'blocks': -1}, {'demand': -1}, {'great': 3}, {'demand': -1}, {'harm': -2}, {'certain': 1}, {'limited': -1}, {'rise': 1}, {'durable': 2}, {'demand': -1}, {'advanced': 1}, {'demand': -1}, {'charged': -3}, {'problem': -2}, {'solution': 1}, {'blocks': -1}, {'pressure': -1}, {'big': 1}, {'clean': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'rises': 1}, {'demand': -1}, {'top': 2}, {'demand': -1}, {'blocks': -1}, {'blocks': -1}, {'top': 2}], 'postive': ['pretty', 'united', 'significant', 'help', 'confident', 'backing', 'worth', 'elegant', 'reach', 'successful', 'great', 'certain', 'rise', 'durable', 'advanced', 'solution', 'big', 'clean', 'like', 'rises', 'top', 'top'], 'negative': ['demand', 'waste', 'negative', 'blocks', 'demand', 'demand', 'harm', 'limited', 'demand', 'demand', 'charged', 'problem', 'blocks', 'pressure', 'demand', 'demand', 'blocks', 'blocks']}}"

But that does not change the minister’s moral obligation to take action on climate change and to protect young people from the harms that it will bring. It does not change the science,” the 17-year-old told reporters. “It does not put out the fires or drain the flood waters.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Our lawyers will be reviewing the judgment, and we will have more to say on possible next steps for the coming weeks, but what I can say today is that we will not stop in our fight for climate justice.”\n    \n\n    \n            Amanda McKenzie, the chief executive of the Climate Council said the ruling was disappointing but the children succeeded in drawing more attention to an important issue.\n    \n\n    \n            “You need a drumbeat, if you like, of information and people saying, ‘this is not okay.’ And I feel like the young people that pushed this case, they really created a moment to focus people’s attention on what climate change means for young Australians. And I think that was really valuable,” she said.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    Record-breaking floods hit eastern Australia\n                \n                    \n                                01:20\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN, Reuters\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n    \n            The children’s initial legal victory didn’t stop the government from approving the Whitehaven Vickery coal mine extension.

It is now estimated the number of extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa has crossed the 500 million mark, half the population. \n    \n\n    \n            This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.  \n    \n\n    \n            These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.  \n    \n\n    \n            But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. “The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action…  and I’m not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,” he says.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want. \n    \n\n    \n             Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure “MPs reflect voters’ views” and to “enable voters remove non-performing leaders.”  \n    \n\n    \n            In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies. \n    \n\n    \n            Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.  \n    \n\n    \n            Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent, from Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte d’Ivoire.  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            The African Union is rightly condemning Guinea’s coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted. \n    \n\n    \n            These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day. \n    \n\n    \n            “If the people are crushed by their elites, it is up to the army to give the people their freedom,” said Guinea’s new leader, quoting the former Ghanaian president Jerry Rawlings who himself led two coups\n    \n\n    \n            It is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new. \n    \n\n    \n            We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred.\n    \n\n    \n             Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            This increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation. \n    \n\n    \n            Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves. \n    \n\n    \n            They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in today’s African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike.    \n    \n\n                ', 'length': 8135, 'description': 'In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210906094028-03-guinea-coup-0905.jpg?q=x_84,y_365,h_1622,w_2882,c_crop/w_800', 'date': '2021-09-12T12:14:45Z', 'keywords': ['africa', ' continents and regions', ' corruption', ' coups and attempted coups', ' elections and campaigns', ' government and public administration', ' guinea', ' military', ' politics', ' society', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war', ' western africa'], 'summary': ['Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening.', 'One in three people are now unemployed in Nigeria, West Africa’s largest economy.', 'The same goes for South Africa, the most industrialized African nation.', 'What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades.', 'Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem.', 'As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred.', 'Can this undesirable trend be reversed?', 'They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans.'], 'sentiment': {'score': -37, 'comparative': -0.03192407247627265, 'calculation': [{'dangerously': -2}, {'worsen': -3}, {'problems': -2}, {'worrying': -3}, {'yes': 1}, {'undesirable': -2}, {'worsening': -3}, {'negative': -2}, {'stable': 2}, {'conflict': -2}, {'violent': -3}, {'like': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'poorer': -2}, {'strong': 2}, {'promise': 1}, {'seduced': -1}, {'desperate': -3}, {'anger': -3}, {'effective': 2}, {'no': -1}, {'freedom': 2}, {'crushed': -2}, {'save': 2}, {'promise': 1}, {'like': 2}, {'perfect': 3}, {'abuses': -3}, {'problem': -2}, {'like': 2}, {'want': 1}, {'no': -1}, {'dropped': -1}, {'guarantee': 1}, {'ensure': 1}, {'want': 1}, {'gains': 2}, {'threat': -2}, {'clear': 1}, {'freedoms': 2}, {'demanding': -1}, {'joy': 3}, {'peace': 2}, {'united': 1}, {'joy': 3}, {'elated': 3}, {'welcome': 2}, {'corrupt': -3}, {'lost': -3}, {'desperate': -3}, {'fertile': 2}, {'poor': -2}, {'unemployed': -1}, {'worsened': -3}, {'tragic': -2}, {'poverty': -1}, {'corrupt': -3}, {'defenders': 2}, {'active': 1}, {'corruption': -3}, {'negative': -2}, {'fighting': -2}, {'poor': -2}, {'corruption': -3}, {'worsening': -3}, {'problems': -2}, {'poverty': -1}, {'corruption': -3}, {'failed': -2}, {'successful': 3}, {'threaten': -2}, {'assassination': -3}, {'unsuccessful': -2}, {'successful': 3}], 'postive': ['yes', 'stable', 'like', 'like', 'strong', 'promise', 'effective', 'freedom', 'save', 'promise', 'like', 'perfect', 'like', 'want', 'guarantee', 'ensure', 'want', 'gains', 'clear', 'freedoms', 'joy', 'peace', 'united', 'joy', 'elated', 'welcome', 'fertile', 'defenders', 'active', 'successful', 'successful'], 'negative': ['dangerously', 'worsen', 'problems', 'worrying', 'undesirable', 'worsening', 'negative', 'conflict', 'violent', 'poorer', 'seduced', 'desperate', 'anger', 'no', 'crushed', 'abuses', 'problem', 'no', 'dropped', 'threat', 'demanding', 'corrupt', 'lost', 'desperate', 'poor', 'unemployed', 'worsened', 'tragic', 'poverty', 'corrupt', 'corruption', 'negative', 'fighting', 'poor', 'corruption', 'worsening', 'problems', 'poverty', 'corruption', 'failed', 'threaten', 'assassination', 'unsuccessful']}}"

But despite covering more than 70% of the Earth’s surface, the ocean is still a relative mystery. In fact, we know more about the surface of Mars than we do about the sea floor; just over 20% of the ocean bed has been mapped.  \n    \n\n    \n            Getting a fuller picture would enable us to navigate ships more safely, create more accurate climate models, lay down telecommunication cables, build offshore windfarms and protect marine species – all part of what’s known as the “blue economy,” projected to be worth $3 trillion by 2030.\n    \n\n    \n            Underwater robotic vehicles equipped with sensors are helping gather that data quicker and more cheaply than ever before. But many of these vehicles rely on batteries with a limited lifespan, and need to return to a boat or the shore to recharge, making it difficult for them to map more remote parts of the sea. \n    \n\n    \n            A five-year-old startup called Seatrec is rising to the challenge, founded by oceanographer Yi Chao. While working at NASA, he developed technology to power ocean robots by harnessing “the naturally occurring temperature difference” of the sea, Chao told CNN Business. \n    \n\n  \n    Greener and cheaper\n\n\n    \n            The power module can be installed on existing data-gathering robots or Seatrec’s own floating device. This dives a kilometer down to examine the chemistry and shape of the seabed, using sonar to create a map of the surrounding area. The robot returns to the surface to send back its findings via satellite.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            As the float moves between colder and warmer parts of the ocean, material inside the module either melts or solidifies, causing pressure that in turn creates thermal energy and powers the robot’s generator.\n    \n\n    \n            “They get charged by the sea, so they can extend their lifetime almost indefinitely,” Chao said.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            A basic float model typically costs around $20,000. Attaching Seatrec’s energy system adds another $25,000, Chao said.\n    \n\n    \n            But the access to free, renewable energy and the ability to stay in the water longer makes data gathering up to five times cheaper in the long run, according to Chao. He said the startup is making fewer than 100 devices per year, primarily for marine researchers, but the technology is easily scalable – Seatrec’s energy module can also be can be retrofitted onto existing mapping devices to extend their range. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            New technologies that can extend the reach of data-gathering devices are crucial for mapping more remote parts of the deep sea, according Jamie McMichael-Phillips, director of the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 Project. \n    \n\n    \n            “One of the huge challenges we have is quite simply physics,” said McMichael-Phillips. “Unlike mapping the Earth’s surface where we can use a camera [or] satellites, at sea, light does not penetrate through the water column. So we’re pretty much limited to using sonar systems.” \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Launched in 2017, the Seabed 2030 Project has increased awareness about the importance of the ocean floor, and given researchers and companies a clear goal to work towards: map the entire seafloor by the end of this decade. \n    \n\n    \n            Some companies, such as XOCEAN, are surveying the ocean from the surface. Another startup, Bedrock Ocean Exploration, says it can provide surveys of seabed areas up to 10 times faster than traditional methods by using an autonomous electric submarine fitted with sonars, cameras and lasers; the data is then analyzed on Bedrock’s own cloud platform.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Even with the growing number of technologies accelerating seabed exploration, completing the map is still a logistical and financial challenge. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Chao estimates that it would take 3,000 of Seatrec’s floats operating over the next 10 years to fully survey the ocean.

Another study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery – Global Open in 2019 found that White patients were overrepresented in the images of plastic surgery journals, which the authors suggested could potentially influence the care non-White patients received. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “For decades, peer-reviewed academic publications have used photographs and images that inadequately portray the diversity in demographics of patients affected by particular diseases,” the researchers wrote. “This is particularly striking in the lack of diversity in medical illustration. These inequities in medical reporting can have lasting downstream effects on the accessibility and provision of healthcare.”\n    \n\n    \n            Ford said that those who aren’t often depicted in medical illustrations “can feel left out and unacknowledged in a healthcare setting, leading to feelings of distrust and isolation when receiving care.” She also said that medical professionals might feel less empathy for groups who aren’t represented – people who are Black, brown, women, transgender or nonbinary – which can lessen the quality of care they receive. \n    \n\n    \n            Inequities in health care have been well-documented, with studies showing that Black patients are more likely to experience bias and be misdiagnosed for certain conditions. Research has also shown that a substantial share of White medical students and residents hold false notions about biological differences between Black and White people, which can lead to racial bias in the ways their pain is perceived and treated.\n    \n\n    \n            Despite the persistent need for medical illustrations to depict the full scope of human diversity, the field is beginning to see changes, medical illustrator Hillary Wilson told CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            Wilson, whose illustrations depict Black people in infographics about eczema, sun damage, alopecia and other conditions, said both patients and practitioners could benefit from seeing diversity represented in medical illustrations. And through her work, she’s attempting to humanize people of color and other marginalized groups by doing just that. \n    \n\n    \n            “The reality is that there are so many different types of people that exist,” she said. “To me, a resource isn’t complete if I didn’t at least consider that and try my best to account for the fact that there are so many different types of people.”\n    \n\n    \n            While Ibe’s image of the Black fetus seemed to mark a departure from the norm, Wilson said she hopes that in the future, seeing Black skin tones in medical illustrations will become routine.\n    \n\n    \n            “Eventually, I hope it can just become one of the things that’s expected,” she added.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 7603, 'description': 'The image, created by Nigerian medical student and illustrator Chidiebere Ibe, struck a chord with countless people on social media, many of whom said that they had never seen a Black fetus depicted before.

But that’s not entirely a good thing. \n    \n\n    \n            “Our cup is ubiquitous, and we love that,” said Michael Kobori, Starbucks chief sustainability officer. “But it is also this ubiquitous symbol of a throwaway society.” \n    \n\n    \n            That’s because the cups are disposable. When they are thrown away, the cups end up in landfills or as litter in streets and waterways. Some might be recycled, but recycling is an imperfect option — recyclable items still end up in landfills.\n    \n\n    \n            The best solution? “Eliminating the disposable cup,” Kobori said. He called that option “the holy grail.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            By 2025, the company wants every customer to be able to either use their own mug easily or borrow a ceramic or reusable to-go mug from their local Starbucks. That could mean rolling out more borrow-a-mug programs that require a deposit. \n    \n\n    \n            Starbucks is also planning, by the end of next year, to let customers use their own personal mugs at every Starbucks in the United States and Canada, even if they order ahead or use the drive-thru. \n    \n\n    \n            The goals don’t mean Starbucks will get rid of the paper and plastic cups. But they do want to make that option less attractive. That won’t be easy to do, as most Starbucks customers are used to that simple, single-use option. But the company has a plan. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            To phase out disposables, Starbucks is considering a widespread borrow-a-cup program, in which customers pay a deposit for a durable cup that they take with them and drop back off after use. \n    \n\n    \n            Amelia Landers, a vice president of product experience whose team is responsible for sustainable packaging at Starbucks, expects that this model will resonate more with customers compared to other sustainability efforts. \n    \n\n    \n            “I think that will take the lead,” she said. “We are testing a number of different [borrow-a-cup] programs around the globe,” including “20 different iterations and in eight different markets.” \n    \n\n    \n            In Seattle, Starbucks tested a beta version of such a program last year.\n    \n\n    \n            “We developed a new cup that had a very low environmental footprint, was lightweight polypropylene, ultimately recyclable and could replace 100 single-use disposable cups,” Landers explained. \n    \n\n    \n            For that test, customers paid a $1 deposit, and had to return the cup to a smart bin located in the store to get their dollar back. Customers also earned rewards for using the cup.\n    \n\n    \n            Kim Davis, who manages a store where the program was tested, said that customers were curious about the bin, and once baristas explained it to them, many were on board with the concept.  \n    \n\n    \n            “The excitement and engagement was really high among my customers and my [employees],” she said. For baristas, the process was straightforward enough — they just used the reusable cup instead of a regular one to prepare drinks. A third-party company collected the dirty cups for cleaning, so baristas didn’t have to worry about that part of the process. \n    \n\n    \n            Starbucks\n            \n                (SBUX) is running similar pilot programs in Japan, Singapore and the United Kingdom.\n    \n\n    \n            The model is the most promising because it’s the easiest to integrate into customers’ daily lives. \n    \n\n    \n            You don’t have to remember to bring your own reusable mug or, if you do, get stuck with a dirty cup for the rest of the day. And you don’t need to sit and sip your coffee at a Starbucks, something most people don’t have time for on a weekday morning. \n    \n\n    \n            But that model is still just being tested, so the company wants to encourage the use of reusable mugs in other ways. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Early in the pandemic, when people feared that the coronavirus could spread easily on surfaces, Starbucks barred customers from bringing their own mugs. It has since brought back the option and is now trying out ways to make it more attractive. \n    \n\n    \n            “We’re testing an incentive on the personal cup to go up from where it is today — from 10 cents to 50 cents,” Landers said. “We are also going to be testing a disposable cup fee.” She added that the chain is also experimenting with discounted prices for people who use a Starbucks-provided ceramic mug in stores. \n    \n\n    \n            That’s simple enough. But it gets a lot more complicated when customers bring their own cups to the drive-thru or when they order ahead through the Starbucks app. \n    \n\n    \n            Years ago, ordering ahead or using a drive-thru might have been a rare enough occasion. But since the pandemic, more customers have been coming through the drive-thru or ordering ahead.\n    \n\n    \n            During a February analyst call, Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri said that Starbucks’ drive-thru windows and its mobile orders together account for about 70% of sales at US stores operated by the company.  \n    \n\n    \n            So to achieve its zero-disposable-cups goal, Starbucks needs to figure out how to get reusables through a drive-thru, and make them available to customers who order ahead. \n    \n\n    \n            To that end, Starbucks has been testing different options at its innovation center. \n    \n\n    \n            “We’ve got mock stores set up,” said Landers. “We have different versions of the drive-thru layout.” \n    \n\n    \n            Customers can simply give their cups to baristas at the drive-thru window. But Starbucks is exploring ways to make the process smoother. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            One option is to allow customers to drop off their cups at an earlier point in the drive-thru lane so that the drink is ready in a personal cup once they swing around to the window, Landers said. Another is for baristas to pre-make drinks when customers place their orders, and pour them into personal tumblers at the window or when they arrive at a store to pick up their order. Starbucks is also testing out cup-washing stations in stores. \n    \n\n    \n            The team is trying “different things, over and over again,” to figure out what might work, she said. “We’re right now in the middle of all of that work.”\n    \n\n    \n            It’s crucial for Starbucks’ mobile order and drive-thru experiences to be seamless. After just a few sluggish pickups, customers may take their business elsewhere.\n    \n\n    \n            But Starbucks also has to be careful not to put too much additional burden on employees, who already have to prepare complicated, customized orders at high speeds. \n    \n\n    \n            That’s especially important now. Workers across the country are considering unionization, going against the wishes of the company’s  leadership. \n    \n\n    \n            A Starbucks, in Buffalo, New York, was the first to vote to unionize in December.

A lot of places have been evacuated. There are more than 600 of us who are foreigners and students.”\n    \n\n    \n            She said most of the group are medical students, and they are from Nigeria, Morocco, Tanzania, Congo and India, among other countries.\n    \n\n    \n            Sumy lies in the northeast of Ukraine, only around 30 miles from the border with Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            As fierce battles between Russian and Ukrainian forces rage across the country, Udenze told CNN via phone that she woke up to two loud explosions around 8 a.m. on Wednesday, and heard gunshots on Thursday. “I am so scared and time is running out. “We don’t want the Russians to enter the city and meet us here. We need a humanitarian corridor so we can get out,” she said.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            As the second round of talks between a delegation from Russia and Ukraine in Belarus ended Thursday, the head of Russian delegation Vladimir Medinsky told Russian media the two sides have agreed on humanitarian corridors for civilians. Udenze later told CNN that more explosions were heard on Thursday evening at around 6 30 p.m local time. The students no longer have electricity or water following the blast, she said. \n    \n\n    \n            Complicating the students’ escape is the fact that there’s no public transportation available in Sumy, which has come over heavy fire in recent days, leaving roads and bridges destroyed.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Fifth-year medical student and Indian national, Shivangi Shibu shared a similar story Thursday. “We just heard some sirens. The situation is going to get worse very soon over here. We don’t have any other options so we just have to run to bunkers,” she told CNN over the phone.\n    \n\n    \n            “No one is talking about Sumy. I hope we will be evacuated soon because we don’t want to be a casualty of this war. We don’t deserve this,” Shibu added.\n    \n\n    \n            “This is our second home but we still need our family. We need to see them. We don’t want to be involved with this politics … The [only] solution is … to allow us to go via the Russian border because we cannot travel to any other destination.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Later Thursday evening, Shibu shared video from her university hostel window of what she said was an air strike over Sumy. It shows a flash of stark light in the distance. “Electricity is gone,” she wrote in the video’s caption.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Excel Ugochukwu is a first-year Business Management student. The student, who is from Nigeria, told CNN: “There were planes flying overhead and a loud explosion. We just lost electricity.”\n    \n\n    \n            He said the university has “asked everyone to stay put and in the shelters for now,” but described a constant threat of danger that makes day-to-day life tense in the city.\n    \n\n    \n            “There is a curfew [from] 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. During curfew hours there are total blackouts. Street lights and lights inside the house are turned off,” he told CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            “There are air strike warnings periodically and everyone moves to the bomb shelter,” he added, before running to a nearby bomb shelter.In a video sent to CNN, another Nigerian student at the university, Nnamdi Chukwuemeka pleaded: “We are trying to bring the attention of the world to the plight of students here in Sumy. \n    \n\n    \n            “Sumy is bordered by Russia, and as such, there is no way for us to escape.

But despite that inevitability, it still made for gruesome yet compelling viewing, like peaking through your fingers while watching a horror movie.\n    \n\n    \n            The sequel to that horror show was Saturday’s 3-0 win against Bordeaux, in which a significant section of PSG fans turned on their own players. During the match, most of the squad was treated to a frosty reception by the Parc des Princes crowd – and some received a frostier welcome than others.\n    \n\n    \n            Most notably Neymar and Lionel Messi, both of who were roundly booed by PSG fans during the build up to the opening goal. There was a loud cheer when Neymar turned the ball into the net, but those cheers promptly turned to jeers once the initial jubilation had subsided.\n    \n\n    \n            READ: Karim Benzema scores hat-trick in 17 minutes as Real Madrid dumps PSG out of Champions League\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Messi arrived in Paris to much fanfare in what was arguably the most shocking player move in history, but the signing has so far been painfully underwhelming for PSG fans.\n    \n\n    \n            The Argentine has mustered a paltry two goals in 18 appearances in Ligue 1 this season, with five more coming in the Champions League, and has looked like a shadow of the player he was even in those later years at Barcelona.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The humiliation against Real Madrid on the pitch was compounded by the widely reported behavior of PSG delegates off it.\n    \n\n    \n            After the game, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Leonardo reportedly confronted the officials in the referees’ dressing room to express their anger at Real Madrid’s first goal, which they believe came after Benzema had committed a foul on Donnarumma.\n    \n\n    \n            UEFA later confirmed that a disciplinary case into the incident had been opened. “The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will take a decision in due course,” European football’s governing body said.\n    \n\n    \n            PSG declined to comment on the UEFA disciplinary case when contacted by CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            While the frustration brought on by PSG’s Champions League failures were directed at the players on the pitch on Saturday, Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo haven’t escaped the ire of the club’s supporters.\n    \n\n    \n            In a statement released earlier on Saturday, club supporter group Collectif Ultra Paris called for Al-Khelaifi’s resignation.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “How can a coach be the respected leader of the changing room when he is clearly not the true decision maker?” was one of several questions posed in the statement.\n    \n\n    \n            “We don’t have a short memory.

But Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia threw a wrench into those plans Monday.\n    \n\n    \n            The crux of the matter is the nomination of Sarah Bloom Raskin, a former deputy Treasury secretary and a governor of the Federal Reserve Board during the Obama administration, who is facing opposition in a divided Senate.\n    \n\n    \n            Raskin’s stance on environmental issues, including her view on the transition away from fossil fuels, are colliding with soaring gas prices and a renewed debate about oil independence in the face of the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n    \n\n    \n            “Her previous public statements have failed to satisfactorily address my concerns about the critical importance of financing an all-of-the-above energy policy to meet our nation’s critical energy needs,” Manchin said in a statement on Monday announcing his opposition to Raskin’s nomination. Manchin is not a member of the Senate Banking Committee that will be voting on Raskin’s candidacy.\n    \n\n    \n            The US Chamber of Commerce already voiced concern over her nomination to be the vice chair of supervision – essentially the Fed’s top banking regulator – in January. And a month ago, Senate Republicans boycotted a vote in protest of Raskin’s nomination, halting a slate of pending nominees for the central bank.\n    \n\n    \n            The renomination of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for another term is also stalled. Even though Powell is enjoying support on both sides of the aisle, he hasn’t been fully confirmed yet, leaving him with the title add-on “pro tempore” for now.\n    \n\n    \n            All this comes at a time when Fed policy has taken center stage amid rampant inflation. Consumer prices haven’t risen at this fast a pace since 1982.\n    \n\n    \n            The central bank is expected to raise interest rates by a quarter-percentage point this week in an effort to curb demand and bring prices under control.\n    \n\n    \n            Meanwhile, the White House continued to stand behind Raskin’s nomination. Biden has pledged to make the Fed more diverse in terms of both its gender and racial make up. The president also nominated Philip Jefferson and Lisa Cook to join the central bank. Cook would be the first Black woman to serve at the Fed in its history.\n    \n\n    \n            “Sarah Bloom Raskin is one of the most qualified people to have ever been nominated for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors – she previously served on the Board and she served as second-in-command at Treasury, both positions where she earned bipartisan Senate confirmation,” a White House official said.\n    \n\n    \n            The administration was working to line up bipartisan support for her confirmation, the official added, calling the adversity surrounding her nomination an “unprecedented, baseless campaign led by oil and gas companies.”\n    \n\n    \n            CNN’s Manu Raju and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.\n    \n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n"", 'length': 10904, 'description': 'President Joe Biden planned to reshape the Federal Reserve through his nominations.

Nobody was sure how long a vaccine would take to develop, let alone whether it would even work. \n    \n\n    \n            “It was a calculated risk,” Poonawalla told CNN Business. “But I didn’t see the choice at that time, to be honest. I just felt I’d regret not committing one way or another.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion. And the lives of hundreds of millions of the planet’s most vulnerable people were at stake, since SII had pledged to provide poorer countries with jabs. If the gamble paid off, Poonawalla would save countless lives and be hailed as a hero during a period of historic turmoil. His fabulously rich family also would stand to grow even more wealthy by profiting from a significant deal. \n    \n\n    \n            As the world gave its money — and trust — to Poonawalla, things seemed to be going according to plan. The AstraZeneca vaccine received approval from UK regulators in December 2020, and Poonawalla became a household name in India. \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            But soon it became evident how badly Poonawalla had miscalculated the challenges that come with distributing millions of vaccines in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic. \n    \n\n    \n            His company’s ability to inoculate even his own countrymen was thrown into doubt earlier this year as a devastating wave of coronavirus hit India. He’s also failed to keep up with his commitment to deliver shots to other nations — the consequences of which have dented his reputation and shed light on the perils of such heavy reliance on one manufacturer. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            It’s easy to see why some of the biggest names in public health chose to rely on Poonawalla. \n    \n\n    \n            Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines. The company — which was founded by Poonawalla’s father, Cyrus, 55 years ago — produces 1.5 billion vaccines each year for measles, rubella, tetanus and many other diseases. The jabs are mainly distributed to low-income countries worldwide, including India. Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world’s babies depend on vaccines made at SII. \n    \n\n    \n            The Poonawalla family charted an unusual path to becoming one of the world’s preeminent vaccine makers. They have bred and raced thoroughbred horses since the 1940s, diversifying into pharmaceuticals, finance and real estate over the last half-century.\n    \n\n    \n            Cyrus Poonawalla is now India’s seventh-richest man, worth more than $16 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. His son Adar took over as CEO in 2011 and has focused on expanding in international markets. \n    \n\n    \n            To prepare for the AstraZeneca vaccine production, Poonawalla said he spent $800 million on buying chemicals, glass vials and other raw materials, as well as ramping up manufacturing capacity at his plant in the Western Indian city of Pune. \n    \n\n    \n            More than $250 million came from the company’s own funds. Another $300 million came from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which SII collaborated with to provide discounted or free doses to low-income countries. The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines. In total, SII agreed to make up to 200 million vaccine doses for as many as 92 countries, as part of its deal with the Gates Foundation and Gavi, a vaccine alliance.\n    \n\n    \n            All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine. Had trials for that vaccine been unsuccessful, SII would “just be making batches and then end up throwing them away,” Poonawalla said.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            A business studies graduate of London’s University of Westminster, Poonawalla said SII was able to make that decision more swiftly than many other companies, since it is a family-run business. \n    \n\n    \n            “The flexibility of being able to decide on the spot very quickly was really the main game-changer that enabled us to be able to do this,” said Poonawalla, whose office in India is a refurbished Airbus A320. \n    \n\n    \n            After UK regulators approved the vaccine, Poonawalla began supplying doses to Indians and other other countries. By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            But Poonawalla’s plans soon went awry when a second wave of Covid-19 hit India in the spring. At its peak the country was reporting over 400,000 cases per day, though experts say the actual number was likely much higher. \n    \n\n    \n            At that point, only 2% percent of India’s 1.3 billion population was fully vaccinated, and the country’s national government had been slow in placing orders for more vaccines. Without a massive stockpile, states in India began to run out of the limited number of jabs they had.\n    \n\n    \n            India then decided to stop the export of all vaccines, preventing SII from keeping up with its commitments elsewhere.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “I’ve always been a patriot for my country … and if my country needs my facility first, I have to do what they say,” Poonawalla said. “There was no two ways about that.”\n    \n\n    \n            The inability to export vaccines hurt some of the poorest nations in the world. The director of Africa’s disease control body, for example, warned India’s hold on exports could be “catastrophic” for the continent. People in several countries, from neighboring Nepal to Kenya, were left stranded after receiving the first dose of Covishield, the name of the India-manufactured vaccine.\n    \n\n    \n            When asked why the global vaccine alliance chose to rely so heavily on one manufacturer, a Gavi spokesperson told CNN Business it had few options. \n    \n\n    \n            At the start of 2021, “very few vaccines were approved and available for deployment,” the spokesperson said, adding that it was “natural” that SII would be contracted for early doses given its size. \n    \n\n    \n            But public health expert Jeffrey Lazarus said there were flaws in the plan. \n    \n\n    \n            “Relying on one manufacturer was a mistake, which is easier to see in hindsight,” said Lazarus, who heads the health systems research group at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            While Poonawalla cannot be held responsible for some of the issues that led to the vaccine rollout stalling — chief among them, India’s massive outbreak — his detractors have questioned parts of his approach. \n    \n\n    \n            They point out Poonawalla hasn’t delivered the number of jabs he initially promised, and they claim he hasn’t been transparent about how he’s been using all of the money he raised for the big vaccine push.\n    \n\n    \n            “There isn’t much accountability for where the money he raised went,” Malini Aisola, co-convenor of health sector watchdog All India Drug Action Network, told CNN Business. \n    \n\n    \n            In June last year, SII pledged it would make one billion doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine for low and middle income countries, with 400 million doses ready by the end of 2020. \n    \n\n    \n            But by January 2021, the company had a stockpile of just 70 million doses. His critics weren’t impressed, given the amount of capital he raised last year. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The global media coverage also turned unfavorable, with headlines linking the global shortfall in vaccines to SII’s problems, including the India export ban and a fire at the company’s Pune facility. At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production. But he has since reversed course, saying that the incident has played a major role in hampering manufacturing.\n    \n\n    \n            He also insists he was realistic about his goals. “We always underpromise,” Poonawalla told CNN Business, when asked whether the company pledged more than it could deliver. \n    \n\n    \n            Still, he’s been dogged by other controversies that have dented his reputation. As India’s Covid-19 cases were skyrocketing in April, Poonawalla lowered the price of his vaccine and referred to the move as a “philanthropic gesture” — leading to heavy criticism, with activists pointing out that even a small profit is still a profit for SII.\n    \n\n    \n            “AstraZeneca has pledged that it won’t make profits from low income and middle income countries during the pandemic, but that does not seem to apply to SII,” Aisola said. \n    \n\n    \n            According to AstraZeneca, the companies the drugmaker has sublicensing agreements with, including SII, dictate their own prices. \n    \n\n    \n            SII declined to comment on how much it has profited from the vaccine efforts so far, but Poonawalla said it is a “very unreasonable and naive way of looking at the world” for people to expect companies not to profit from the vaccine. \n    \n\n    \n            While Poonawalla has yet to match his lofty goals, there is a chance that he and SII can get back on track, which is critical to ending vaccine inequality worldwide. India has decided to begin exporting vaccines once again as its own rate of inoculation increases. The nation had administered one billion doses by October — about 90% of which came from SII, according to the company.\n    \n\n    \n            SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October. \n    \n\n    \n            SII is also expanding its partnerships, having signed a deal with American biotech firm Novavax to manufacture its Covid-19 vaccine, which is awaiting regulatory approvals. It’s also partnering with the Russian Direct Investment Fund on production of the Sputnik vaccine.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 10542, 'description': 'As Covid-19 wreaked havoc around the world last year, the 39-year-old son of an Indian billionaire was laying the groundwork for a plan he hoped would eventually end the pandemic.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/211028160213-restricted-01-risk-takers-series-adar-poonawalla-serum-institute-of-india.jpg?q=x_2,y_164,h_1123,w_1995,c_crop/w_800', 'date': '2021-11-02T11:02:09Z', 'keywords': ['asia', ' astrazeneca plc', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' communicable disease control', ' companies', ' continents and regions', ' coronavirus', ' demographic groups', ' diseases and disorders', ' employment and income status', ' epidemics and outbreaks', ' health and medical', ' india', ' infectious diseases', ' labor and employment', ' life forms', ' low income persons', ' microscopic life', ' pharmaceutical industry', ' pharmaceuticals', ' population and demographics', ' public health', ' respiratory diseases', ' social and economic status', ' society', ' south asia', ' vaccination and immunization', ' viruses', ' wealthy people', ' pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs'], 'summary': ['“It was a calculated risk,” Poonawalla told CNN Business.', 'To make his plan work, Poonawalla first had to raise nearly $1 billion.', 'Few manufacturers can come close to the scale at which SII is able to produce vaccines.', 'Poonawalla estimates that just over 50% of the world’s babies depend on vaccines made at SII.', 'The rest was paid by other countries once SII started accepting orders for vaccines.', 'All of that happened, though, before regulators signed off on the AstraZeneca vaccine.', 'By May, Gavi had received some 30 million jabs from SII.', 'At the time Poonawalla said the fire had no effect on Covishield production.', 'SII also says that it has increased its production to 220 million doses a month as of October.'], 'sentiment': {'score': -7, 'comparative': -0.004438807863031071, 'calculation': [{'increased': 1}, {'chance': 2}, {'profit': 2}, {'naive': -2}, {'profits': 2}, {'profit': 2}, {'profit': 2}, {'criticism': -2}, {'leading': 2}, {'controversies': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'fire': -2}, {'fire': -2}, {'ban': -2}, {'problems': -2}, {'unfavorable': -2}, {'impressed': 3}, {'critics': -2}, {'big': 1}, {'promised': 1}, {'questioned': -1}, {'outbreak': -2}, {'stalling': -2}, {'responsible': 2}, {'mistake': -2}, {'flaws': -2}, {'approved': 2}, {'warned': -2}, {'disease': -1}, {'poorest': -2}, {'hurt': -2}, {'inability': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'preventing': -1}, {'stop': -1}, {'limited': -1}, {'approved': 2}, {'swiftly': 2}, {'unsuccessful': -2}, {'agreed': 1}, {'accepting': 1}, {'free': 1}, {'discounted': -1}, {'focused': 2}, {'worth': 2}, {'diseases': -1}, {'easy': 1}, {'commitment': 2}, {'failed': -2}, {'devastating': -2}, {'doubt': -1}, {'ability': 2}, {'badly': -3}, {'approval': 2}, {'trust': 1}, {'significant': 1}, {'wealthy': 2}, {'rich': 2}, {'fabulously': 4}, {'hero': 2}, {'hailed': 2}, {'save': 2}, {'poorer': -2}, {'vulnerable': -2}, {'committing': -1}, {'regret': -2}, {'honest': 2}, {'risk': -2}, {'alone': -2}, {'committed': 1}, {'havoc': -2}], 'postive': ['increased', 'chance', 'profit', 'profits', 'profit', 'profit', 'leading', 'impressed', 'big', 'promised', 'responsible', 'approved', 'approved', 'swiftly', 'agreed', 'accepting', 'free', 'focused', 'worth', 'easy', 'commitment', 'ability', 'approval', 'trust', 'significant', 'wealthy', 'rich', 'fabulously', 'hero', 'hailed', 'save', 'honest', 'committed'], 'negative': ['naive', 'criticism', 'controversies', 'no', 'fire', 'fire', 'ban', 'problems', 'unfavorable', 'critics', 'questioned', 'outbreak', 'stalling', 'mistake', 'flaws', 'warned', 'disease', 'poorest', 'hurt', 'inability', 'no', 'preventing', 'stop', 'limited', 'unsuccessful', 'discounted', 'diseases', 'failed', 'devastating', 'doubt', 'badly', 'poorer', 'vulnerable', 'committing', 'regret', 'risk', 'alone', 'havoc']}}"

It also brought attention to a larger issue at hand: A lack of diversity in medical illustrations.\n    \n\n    \n            (While most fetuses are red in color – newborns come out dark pink or red and only gradually develop the skin tone they will have for life – the medical illustration is intended to represent patients who aren’t used to seeing their skin tones in such images.)\n    \n\n    \n            Ibe said in an interview with HuffPost UK that he didn’t expect to receive such an overwhelming response – his fetus illustration was one of many such images he’s created as a medical illustrator, most of which depict Black skin tones. But it underscored the importance of a mission he’s long been committed to.\n    \n\n    \n            “The whole purpose was to keep talking about what I’m passionate about – equity in healthcare – and also to show the beauty of Black people,” he told the publication. “We don’t only need more representation like this – we need more people willing to create representation like this.”\n    \n\n    \n            CNN reached out to Ibe for comment, but he did not expand on the topic further.\n    \n\n    \n            Ni-Ka Ford, diversity committee chair for the Association of Medical Illustrators, said that the organization was grateful for Ibe’s illustration.\n    \n\n    \n            “Along with the importance of representation of Black and Brown bodies in medical illustration, his illustration also serves to combat another major flaw in the medical system, that being the staggering disproportionate maternal mortality rate of Black women in this country,” she wrote in an email to CNN.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Medical illustrations have been used for thousands of years to record and communicate procedures, pathologies and other facets of medical knowledge, from the ancient Egyptians to Leonardo da Vinci. Science and art are combined to translate complex information into visuals that can communicate concepts to students, practitioners and the public. These images are used not just in textbooks and scientific journals, but also films, presentations and other mediums.\n    \n\n    \n            There are fewer than 2,000 trained medical illustrators in the world, according to the Association of Medical Illustrators. With only a handful of accredited medical illustration programs in North America, which tend to be expensive and admit few students, the field has historically been dominated by people who are White and male – which, in turn, means the bodies depicted have usually been so, too.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “Historically [medical illustrations] have always featured white able bodied male figures and still do in the present day,” Ford said. “Bias towards one body type in medical illustration marginalizes everyone else.”\n    \n\n    \n            Studies have backed up this lack of diversity. Researchers at the University of Wollogong in Australia found in a 2014 study that out of more than 6,000 images with an identifiable sex across 17 anatomy textbooks published between 2008 and 2013, just 36% of the depicted bodies were female. A vast majority were White. About 3% of the images analyzed showed disabled bodies, while just 2% featured elderly people.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Diversity in the field of medical illustrations (or lack thereof) matters because these images can have implications for medical trainees, practitioners and patients. \n    \n\n    \n            “Without equitable representation and the perpetual use of only white able bodied patients depicted in medical textbooks, medical professionals are limited in their ability to accurately diagnose and treat people who don’t fit that mold,” Ford said. “Medical professionals can then tend to rely on racial stereotypes and generalizations because of this knowledge gap on how symptoms present differently on darker skin tones, leading to poorer care.”\n    \n\n    \n            A study by the same University of Wollogong researchers published in 2018 found that gender-biased images from anatomy textbooks increased medical students’ scores on implicit bias tests. Another study published in the journal Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery – Global Open in 2019 found that White patients were overrepresented in the images of plastic surgery journals, which the authors suggested could potentially influence the care non-White patients received. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “For decades, peer-reviewed academic publications have used photographs and images that inadequately portray the diversity in demographics of patients affected by particular diseases,” the researchers wrote. “This is particularly striking in the lack of diversity in medical illustration. These inequities in medical reporting can have lasting downstream effects on the accessibility and provision of healthcare.”\n    \n\n    \n            Ford said that those who aren’t often depicted in medical illustrations “can feel left out and unacknowledged in a healthcare setting, leading to feelings of distrust and isolation when receiving care.” She also said that medical professionals might feel less empathy for groups who aren’t represented – people who are Black, brown, women, transgender or nonbinary – which can lessen the quality of care they receive. \n    \n\n    \n            Inequities in health care have been well-documented, with studies showing that Black patients are more likely to experience bias and be misdiagnosed for certain conditions. Research has also shown that a substantial share of White medical students and residents hold false notions about biological differences between Black and White people, which can lead to racial bias in the ways their pain is perceived and treated.\n    \n\n    \n            Despite the persistent need for medical illustrations to depict the full scope of human diversity, the field is beginning to see changes, medical illustrator Hillary Wilson told CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            Wilson, whose illustrations depict Black people in infographics about eczema, sun damage, alopecia and other conditions, said both patients and practitioners could benefit from seeing diversity represented in medical illustrations.

 Known for being one of the most entertaining names in golf, the Irishman caused the Players Championship to erupt on Sunday, hitting a hole-in-one on the famous 17th. \n    \n\n    \n            During the third round of one of the PGA Tour’s marquee events, Lowry achieved the feat at the par-three, 124-yard island hole, which he described afterwards as “one of the most iconic holes in golf.”\n    \n\n    \n            The 34-year-old hit a pitching wedge with the ball landing approximately 10 feet past the hole before it gradually rolled towards the pin and dropped in, sparking wild scenes of celebration. \n    \n\n    \n            He embraced his playing partner and Ryder Cup teammate Ian Poulter as the crowd went wild. \n    \n\n    \n            After picking the ball out of the hole, Lowry threw the ball into the crowd and later signed it.  \n    \n\n    \n            “It was a special thing to happen, and I’m looking forward to turning on my phone and seeing the messages I’ve got,” Lowry explained. \n    \n\n    \n            “Not only that, it put me back in the tournament somewhat. So it was amazing. It’s been a long day today, and I’m glad to make the call and finish well today. Played the 17 hole twice and did it in three shots, so it doesn’t owe me anything.\n    \n\n    \n            “I’m excited for tomorrow now. If it’s a long day tomorrow, I can do something hopefully in the morning and finish it off in the afternoon.”\n    \n\n    \n            It’s the 10th hole-in-one on the 17th hole at TPC Sawgrass, and the first since Ryan Moore achieved the feat at the 2019 edition of the Players Championship. \n    \n\n    \n            It is Lowry’s second hole-in-one on the PGA Tour, his first coming at the 2016 Masters. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Lowry is now four-under for the tournament, four off the top of the leaderboard. \n    \n\n    \n            This year’s Players Championship has had severe delays after inclement weather swept into the area in Florida. \n    \n\n    \n            Because of high winds, raining and electric storms, when play resumes on Monday morning, all 71 players left in the field will still have to complete their third rounds. \n    \n\n    \n            India’s Anirban Lahiri leads on nine under. \n    \n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n', 'length': 2543, 'description': 'If you watch Shane Lowry play golf, he’s sure to eventually make you get out of your seat.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220314092828-01-shane-lowry-hole-in-one.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-14T10:34:52Z', 'keywords': ['golf', ' golf events', ' sports and recreation', ' sports events', ' the players championship'], 'summary': ['CNN — If you watch Shane Lowry play golf, he’s sure to eventually make you get out of your seat.', 'After picking the ball out of the hole, Lowry threw the ball into the crowd and later signed it.', 'It’s been a long day today, and I’m glad to make the call and finish well today.', 'Played the 17 hole twice and did it in three shots, so it doesn’t owe me anything.', 'Lowry is now four-under for the tournament, four off the top of the leaderboard.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 18, 'comparative': 0.049723756906077346, 'calculation': [{'severe': -2}, {'top': 2}, {'hopefully': 2}, {'excited': 3}, {'glad': 3}, {'amazing': 4}, {'celebration': 3}, {'dropped': -1}, {'famous': 2}, {'entertaining': 2}], 'postive': ['top', 'hopefully', 'excited', 'glad', 'amazing', 'celebration', 'famous', 'entertaining'], 'negative': ['severe', 'dropped']}}"

But it does mean the club is not able to sell merchandise or tickets to upcoming games, engage in the transfer market, or issue new contracts to players.\n    \n\n    \n            Last month British lawmaker Chris Bryant called for Abramovich to lose ownership of Chelsea after seeing a leaked 2019 UK Home Office document that flagged concerns the 55-year-old had “links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices,” the MP said in Parliament.\n    \n\n    \n            According to Reuters, Abramovich has been granted Portuguese and Israeli citizenship in recent years.  \n    \n\n    \n            “Surely, Mr. Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country?” Bryant said.\n    \n\n    \n            Abramovich’s representative did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on the oligarch being sanctioned.\n    \n\n    \n            Spurred by Abramovich’s enormous financial investment – upwards of $1.99 billion according to respected football business blogger Swiss Ramble – Chelsea has enjoyed an unprecedented period of success since his $233 million acquisition of the club in June 2003.\n    \n\n    \n            “I don’t want to throw my money away,” Abramovich told the BBC following the takeover, “but it’s really about having fun and that means success and trophies.”\n    \n\n    \n            During the 19 years under Abramovich, the club has collected 21 major trophies, according to Chelsea. After winning the FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi last month, Chelsea has officially won ever major trophy at the club’s disposal.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    How Chelsea fans are reacting to sanctions on club owner\n                \n                    \n                                02:56\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n  \n\n    \n            It is gratitude for this golden era that underpinned a sweeping tide of adulation for the oligarch upon the announcement of his impending sale of the club, among fans as well as former players.\n    \n\n    \n            “The best,” former captain John Terry tweeted, accompanied by a picture of him and Abramovich celebrating another Premier League triumph in 2017.\n    \n\n    \n            A statement from the Chelsea Supporters Trust (CST) board encapsulated the broader outpouring of feeling among the club’s fans on social media, thanking Abramovich for “his affection, passion and dedication” during a tenure that brought “unparalleled success.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Chelsea supporters will never forget all he has done for our club. Thank you Mr Abramovich,” the statement added, published before the UK government announced the sanctions.\n    \n\n    \n            According to Richard Weekes, who is one of the founders of Chelsea supporters’ group ‘We Are The Shed,’ “the Roman Empire” helped realize supporters’ wildest dreams.\n    \n\n    \n            “The last 20 years has enabled Chelsea supporters to live their best lives,” Weekes told CNN before Abramovich would be sanctioned.\n    \n\n    \n            “Traveling around the world winning and celebrating the biggest prizes in football, you simply cannot ask for more than that and, for that reason, Roman will forever have a place in all Chelsea supporters’ hearts.\n    \n\n    \n            “To have ‘the Roman Empire’ come to an end with Chelsea as ‘Champions of the World’ could not be a more fitting conclusion to this chapter in our history.”\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            If the last 19 years have been jam-packed with golden memories and trophy after trophy, the coming days and months look more uncertain.\n    \n\n    \n            In light of the sanctions placed on Abramovich and the consequential impact on Chelsea, the club released a statement confirming it would seek “permission for the licence to be amended in order to allow the Club to operate as normal as possible.”\n    \n\n    \n            Amid such turmoil, the CST called for the voices of supporters to be heard.\n    \n\n    \n            “Supporters MUST be involved in any conversation regarding ongoing impacts on the club and its global fanbase,” the group said in a statement on Twitter. \n    \n\n    \n            “The CST implores the Government to conduct a swift process to minimise the uncertainty over Chelsea’s future, for supporters and for supporters to be given a golden share as part of a sale of the club.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            The sanctions also prevent a sale of the club, pending the issuance of a special license.\n    \n\n    \n            In his initial statement published on the club’s website before he was sanctioned, Abramovich said the net proceeds from the sale will be donated to a foundation set up “for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine.”  \n    \n\n    \n            That statement was conspicuously vague regarding who specifically might be a victim; Abramovich’s critics pointed out that the wording could also allow his new foundation to support the families of Russian soldiers.  \n    \n\n    \n            “Roman Abramovich is very sensitive to what is happening now,” Mikhail Khordokovsky, an exiled oligarch and Putin critic, told CNN before the recent sanctions were announced. \n    \n\n    \n            “I don’t have any information, but I can’t imagine that he’s made any decision without first consulting with Putin.\n    \n\n    \n            “Regardless, this means that he’s gotten a whiff of scorched air. What he smells is the fire burning under President Putin,” Khodorkovsky said, referring to Abramovich’s plans to sell Chelsea.\n    \n\n  \n  \n\n    \n      What CAN the club do?Pay allowances and pensions of all employees of the Club, including the wages of Players and coaching staff.Pay reasonable costs of travel to and from Fixtures but “not exceeding the value of £20,000 per game per Club team.”Pay reasonable costs necessary for the purposes of the Club hosting Fixtures at its home grounds but “not exceeding the value of £500,000 per Fixture per Club Team.”Pay fees, dividends or other allowances to directors of the Club.Pay “reasonable fees” or other costs directly related to ongoing regular maintenance of the Club.Broadcasters may broadcast any Fixtures involving the Club.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            In 2018 the US Treasury released the names of 210 prominent Russians, dubbed the “Putin list.”\n    \n\n    \n            The administration was required to name the companies and individuals and consider whether to sanction them under legislation meant to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 US election, as well as its human rights violations, annexation of Crimea, and ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            The list, which included  Abramovich, reads like the US has “simply rewritten the Kremlin’s phone book,” said Russian senator Konstantin Kosachev in a Facebook post at the time.\n    \n\n    \n            But if Abramovich’s current wealth and apparent safety in Russia reflect an affinity with Putin, that may have been what put him at risk with the UK government. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “He is one of the few oligarchs from the 1990s to maintain prominence under Putin. None of our allies have yet sanctioned Abramovich,” the UK government said in a statement on Thursday. Canada have since sanctioned Abramovich too.\n    \n\n    \n            Abramovich made his fortune in steel and investments, taking advantage of the mass privatization that characterized Boris Yeltsin’s premiership following the fall of the Soviet Union.\n    \n\n    \n            Abramovich’s wealth, valued at $14.5 billion in 2022 by Forbes, led to influence within Russian political circles as he was first elected to the State Duma and then appointed governor of Chukotka from 2000 to 2008.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            While Weekes admitted that the incoming owner’s status as an oligarch had played on his mind back in 2003, he added that fans would have had little power to reverse the takeover regardless of their feelings.\n    \n\n    \n            “Chelsea fans did not choose to be bought,” Weekes said, “it is unlikely any pushback would have changed the decision at the time had we stopped to think about the morality behind it.\n    \n\n    \n            “Today people are more prepared to look into things a little deeper, to understand right from wrong and, with regards to a football club, have the desire to know that who is representing their team suits their ideologies and beliefs. This is a good thing.\n    \n\n    \n            “Only time will tell if our feeling towards his character will change but, for now, there is no denying the happiness he brought to Chelsea supporters during his time here and for that we are thankful.”\n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n    \n      What CAN’T the club do?Enter into transfer deals for new players or receive money for selling existing players.Issue new contracts to existing players.Sell any new tickets to upcoming games – only season ticket holders can go to games for the foreseeable future.Sell any merchandise – however, any third parties who purchased or produced Club Merchandise prior to Thursday are permitted to sell stock.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n            This schism between appreciation and criticism manifested itself in Chelsea’s league fixtures at Burnley on March 5 and at Norwich City on March 10.\n    \n\n    \n            As a minute’s applause was held in tribute to Ukraine before the Burnley game, chants of Abramovich’s name could be heard on a Sky Sports broadcast before being drowned out by boos from the stands.\n    \n\n    \n            The chants drew reproach from Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel after the game.\n    \n\n    \n            “If we show solidarity, we show solidarity and we should do it together. We take the knee together, if an important person from other clubs or from our club unfortunately dies, we show a minute of respect,” Tuchel told reporters after the game, which Chelsea won 4-0. \n    \n\n    \n            “It’s not the moment to give other messages, it’s a moment to show respect. We do this because this is what we are also as a club, we show respect as a club.

Rumors of potential buyers continue to abound, but as yet it remains to be seen when the club’s future will be clarified.\n    \n\n    \n            Who will the new owner be?

something that would prevent most from trying rock climbing, but for Lor Sabourin, it’s what they love most about the sport. \n    \n\n    \n            Being so far out of their comfort zone, tackling a route that requires both mental and physical fortitude, provides Sabourin with an opportunity to reflect and work through the challenges in their life. \n    \n\n    \n            In many ways, it’s much more than just a sport for them – it’s a way of exploring identity which has helped them accept who they are. \n    \n\n    \n            “I think it’s really hard to hide from the stress of climbing. When you go out, you’re really choosing to be vulnerable,” Sabourin tells CNN Sport.\n    \n\n    \n            “You don’t have to do that everywhere else in life.\n    \n\n    \n            “People are able to really find out how they do best when they’re in stress and to learn better ways to respond to stress and to things like fear and insecurity.” \n    \n\n    \n            Sabourin has recently released a film with Patagonia that explores their life as a non-binary climber, following Sabourin as they take on one of the hardest routes of their life in the sandstone canyons of northern Arizona. \n    \n\n    \n            It provided Sabourin with a chance to speak about their journey and address what it means for them to be a trans climber in 2021.\n    \n\n    \n            In tackling some dark periods of their life – including battles with eating disorders, self-harm and sexual assault – the film “They/Them” shows how Sabourin has learned to thrive in the climbing community. \n    \n\n    \n            “Making the film was hard in a lot of ways because, so often when we go through something hard and then come out on the other side, we want to just pretend that that didn’t happen,” they added.\n    \n\n    \n            “So I really had to go back to parts of my story that maybe I didn’t talk about with people in my life very often. \n    \n\n    \n            “And that was at first really challenging, but over time, it actually became really healing.” \n    \n\n\n    \n            READ: Climber receives apology after inappropriate images were aired during World Championships\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Despite always loving the outdoor lifestyle, even when growing up in the urban area of Detroit, Sabourin was a self-confessed “super-scared kid.” \n    \n\n    \n            It may seem improbable now when you see photos of them hanging off the side of a rock face, but there was a time when they were too scared to use the three-meter slide at their local swimming pool. \n    \n\n    \n            In truth, climbing wasn’t something that came naturally, but sport always played a major role in their upbringing. \n    \n\n    \n            They were a strong runner throughout their education but finally fell into climbing as a way of combining competition with their love of the outdoors. \n    \n\n    \n            “[Climbing] is very all-consuming,” Sabourin said. “Running, for example, it’s like your mind can go anywhere and you can still run quite quickly.\n    \n\n    \n            “And that’s one of my favorite things about running is having a place where I can just let my mind go, and climbing isn’t really that way. \n    \n\n    \n            “When you’re climbing, you have to have 100% of your attention on what you’re doing. And that’s really therapeutic in its own way.” \n    \n\n\n    \n            READ: ‘We should be less afraid to be afraid,’ says Emily Harrington after historic El Capitan climb\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    'Black Ice': The men and women making climbing more diverse\n                \n                    \n                                03:34\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The sport now plays a major role in their life and they balance it with their studies to become a therapist. \n    \n\n    \n            However, as their profile within the sport becomes more well-known, Sabourin has had to deal with online hate and microaggressions from within the community, such as people reacting angrily about using different pronouns. \n    \n\n    \n            In the film, they describe how they were subject to online abuse after an interview with climbing magazine “Rock and Ice” was published. \n    \n\n    \n            There are also times in normal life where Sabourin feels less safe than their non-trans friends. \n    \n\n    \n            “I guess that’s really challenging, especially having a background of experiencing pretty extreme violence at a young age for my identity,” they said. \n    \n\n    \n            “With the film, it definitely brings up that fear. I am putting myself out there in a really public way, and so it’s definitely opening up to the potential for more of that to happen.\n    \n\n    \n            “But […] in all of those interactions, people didn’t take the time to get to know me.\n    \n\n    \n            “What I feel is really powerful about the film […] is you kind of have to stay with me long enough to learn that I’m a human just like anyone else and that being trans is one aspect. \n    \n\n    \n            “Something that I really love about myself is my identity, but it actually is a fairly small aspect of my identity in the grand scheme of things.” \n    \n\n\n    \n            READ: Two world-class climbers scale the tallest chimney in Europe\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The process of making the film was an intimate affair, with Sabourin often being joined just by co-director and friend Blake McCord. They didn’t want the film to make generalizations about the trans experience, but instead share their own unique story in a humanistic way. \n    \n\n    \n            Sabourin is aware that they may become the face for the wider community as a result. \n    \n\n    \n            At a time when trans people are facing scrutiny in both the sporting arena and in wider society, Sabourin says climbing has an opportunity to create a more inclusive framework that other sports can follow. \n    \n\n    \n            “I think it could be simpler than people believe,” they said. “They get so hung up in the political debates and the legislation.\n    \n\n    \n            “If we look at the value of sports to people, as humans, and the reasons that we participate and we strip it down back to that human aspect, it’s a lot simpler than we think it is.”\n    \n\n    \n            Sabourin says the thought of being a role model feels similar to tackling climbing projects – intimidating, but also inspiring – and admits the thought of people looking up to them has made them become more honest in their personal life. \n    \n\n    \n            The American has struggled with eating disorders since they were seven or eight years old and wants to trigger conversations about how it can affect both athletes and the trans community. \n    \n\n    \n            Now in recovery, Sabourin has learned to adopt a healthier relationship with food and exercise and has realized the destructive ways in which they were using food to manage their transition. \n    \n\n    \n            Visit

holding myself really accountable and being really firm with myself about taking steps every day, but also give myself some levity around it and not always feel like I’m beating my head against the wall,” Sabourin said. \n    \n\n    \n            “I want people to have a role model that’s someone who takes care of themselves, who lives a life that they think is meaningful. \n    \n\n    \n

While China has mostly contained the spread of COVID-19 during the pandemic, and even though cases remain relatively low, recent outbreaks of the virus including the emergence of the highly contagious Omicron variant have prompted the government to lockdown nearly 20 million people in various major cities and to reinforce stricter health measures.

It didn’t elaborate on which locations would take on extra work. \n    \n\n    \n            Shares in Taipei-based Foxconn Interconnect Technology, a subsidiary of Foxconn, plunged 9.8% in Hong Kong on Monday. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            China is grappling with its worst Covid outbreak since the original outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020 as cases surge across the country. On Sunday, it reported 2,125 local Covid-19 cases across 58 cities, according to the National Health Commission (NHC). \n    \n\n    \n            In Shenzhen, all businesses — apart from those deemed essential or engaged in supplying Hong Kong — have suspended operation or have implemented work-from-home policies. \n    \n\n    \n            Public transportation, including subways and buses, have been suspended in the city, which has a population of 17.5 million.\n    \n\n    \n            Shenzhen is also home to one of the world’s largest container ports, and any disruption there could hit an already stressed out global supply chain. Last summer, the Yantian port in Shenzhen was forced to shut down for nearly a week after infections were found among dock workers, causing a massive backlog of goods that took months to clear and a spike in global freight rates. So far the port continues to operate.\n    \n\n    \n            Shares of major companies based in Shenzhen fared poorly in Hong Kong on Monday. Tencent sank 9.8%. Telecoms firm ZTE\n            \n                (ZTCOF) lost 7%. BYD\n            \n                (BYDDF), China’s largest electric car manufacturer, fell 8.3%. And AAC Technologies\n            \n                (AACAF), an audio components maker, plunged 9%.\n    \n\n    \n            Apart from Shenzhen, local authorities have also locked down the northeastern industrial hub of Changchun since Friday, where nine million residents were forbidden from leaving their neighborhoods. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Shanghai, the country’s largest business center, has imposed stringent measures after a spike in Covid cases, closing schools and cinemas and restricting travel into the city. \n    \n\n    \n            These lockdowns come just months after China shut the northwestern city of Xi’an, which hit major business operations, including those of Samsung and Micron, two of the world’s biggest chipmakers.\n    \n\n    \n            These stringent measures taken to control the pandemic have hit China’s economy hard in recent times. Earlier this month, the government set an economic growth target at around 5.5% for 2022, the lowest official goal in decades. \n    \n\n    \n            — CNN’s Beijing bureau contributed to this report.\n    \n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n\n          \n        \n          \n    \n        \n      \n        CNN Business Videos\n      \n\n    \n\n\n      \n      \n    ', 'length': 11301, 'description': 'Foxconn, one of Apple’s biggest suppliers, has suspended operations in Shenzhen as China locks down the technology hub and several other regions to contain the country’s worst Covid-19 outbreak in two years.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220314024938-foxconn-shenzen-file-2019.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-14T09:50:22Z', 'keywords': ['apple inc', ' asia', ' china', ' companies', ' continents and regions', ' east asia', ' epidemics and outbreaks', ' foxconn', ' health and medical', ' public health', ' shenzhen', ' south china', ' technology', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' economy and economic indicators', ' hong kong', ' international relations', ' international relations and national security', ' territorial and national borders'], 'summary': [""08 - Source: CNN China 15 videos How much longer can China's economy handle 'zero-Covid'?"", 'Foxconn has two major campuses in Shenzhen.', 'Shares of major companies based in Shenzhen fared poorly in Hong Kong on Monday.', 'Tencent sank 9.8%.', 'BYD (BYDDF), China’s largest electric car manufacturer, fell 8.3%.', 'And AAC Technologies (AACAF), an audio components maker, plunged 9%.', 'CNN Business Videos'], 'sentiment': {'score': -39, 'comparative': -0.05111402359108781, 'calculation': [{'lowest': -1}, {'growth': 2}, {'hard': -1}, {'restricting': -2}, {'imposed': -1}, {'forbidden': -2}, {'lost': -3}, {'poorly': -2}, {'shares': 1}, {'clear': 1}, {'infections': -2}, {'forced': -1}, {'stressed': -2}, {'disruption': -2}, {'suspended': -1}, {'suspended': -1}, {'outbreak': -2}, {'outbreak': -2}, {'worst': -3}, {'shares': 1}, {'disruption': -2}, {'positive': 2}, {'imposed': -1}, {'like': 2}, {'outbreak': -2}, {'worst': -3}, {'suspended': -1}, {'penalty': -2}, {'huge': 1}, {'arrests': -2}, {'crisis': -3}, {'boycotts': -2}, {'crisis': -3}, {'crisis': -3}, {'revive': 2}, {'please': 1}], 'postive': ['growth', 'shares', 'clear', 'shares', 'positive', 'like', 'huge', 'revive', 'please'], 'negative': ['lowest', 'hard', 'restricting', 'imposed', 'forbidden', 'lost', 'poorly', 'infections', 'forced', 'stressed', 'disruption', 'suspended', 'suspended', 'outbreak', 'outbreak', 'worst', 'disruption', 'imposed', 'outbreak', 'worst', 'suspended', 'penalty', 'arrests', 'crisis', 'boycotts', 'crisis', 'crisis']}}"

But despite that inevitability, it still made for gruesome yet compelling viewing, like peaking through your fingers while watching a horror movie.\n    \n\n    \n            The sequel to that horror show was Saturday’s 3-0 win against Bordeaux, in which a significant section of PSG fans turned on their own players. During the match, most of the squad was treated to a frosty reception by the Parc des Princes crowd – and some received a frostier welcome than others.\n    \n\n    \n            Most notably Neymar and Lionel Messi, both of who were roundly booed by PSG fans during the build up to the opening goal. There was a loud cheer when Neymar turned the ball into the net, but those cheers promptly turned to jeers once the initial jubilation had subsided.\n    \n\n    \n            READ: Karim Benzema scores hat-trick in 17 minutes as Real Madrid dumps PSG out of Champions League\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Messi arrived in Paris to much fanfare in what was arguably the most shocking player move in history, but the signing has so far been painfully underwhelming for PSG fans.\n    \n\n    \n            The Argentine has mustered a paltry two goals in 18 appearances in Ligue 1 this season, with five more coming in the Champions League, and has looked like a shadow of the player he was even in those later years at Barcelona.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The humiliation against Real Madrid on the pitch was compounded by the widely reported behavior of PSG delegates off it.\n    \n\n    \n            After the game, club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and sporting director Leonardo reportedly confronted the officials in the referees’ dressing room to express their anger at Real Madrid’s first goal, which they believe came after Benzema had committed a foul on Donnarumma.\n    \n\n    \n            UEFA later confirmed that a disciplinary case into the incident had been opened. “The UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body will take a decision in due course,” European football’s governing body said.\n    \n\n    \n            PSG declined to comment on the UEFA disciplinary case when contacted by CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            While the frustration brought on by PSG’s Champions League failures were directed at the players on the pitch on Saturday, Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo haven’t escaped the ire of the club’s supporters.\n    \n\n    \n            In a statement released earlier on Saturday, club supporter group Collectif Ultra Paris called for Al-Khelaifi’s resignation.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “How can a coach be the respected leader of the changing room when he is clearly not the true decision maker?” was one of several questions posed in the statement.\n    \n\n    \n            “We don’t have a short memory. We know what our return owes to president Nasser Al-Khelaifi but it is clear he is not the man for the job.\n    \n\n    \n            “The club’s current situation requires complete reorganization at all levels going forward and the daily presence of its president.”\n    \n\n    \n            On Monday, fan frustration was visible for all to see at PSG’s training center and Parc des Princes stadium, where insults and calls for Al-Khelaifi and Leonardo to leave the club were sprayed onto the facilities.\n    \n\n    \n            “Nasser, Leo out,” read one piece of graffiti, thought to be aimed at Leonardo rather than Messi.\n    \n\n    \n            Likewise, head coach Mauricio Pochettino did not escape from the Real Madrid debacle without any blame. Unsurprisingly, the Argentine has faced calls for his sacking or resignation, but Leonardo insisted that wasn’t a solution.\n    \n\n    \n            “We shouldn’t throw everything in the bin,” he told RMC Sport. “We shouldn’t start from scratch after every loss. The objective is to win the Champions League, and until half time we were fine.\n    \n\n    \n            “We have to look to improve this team and maintain morale to play in Ligue 1 and to finish the season well. We should stay together. Pochettino is still part of the project for this season. It’s not the time to think about that.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            With 10 games left in Ligue 1 and holding a 15-point lead over second-place Marseille, PSG is almost certain to secure its seventh French league title in eight season.\n    \n\n    \n            Following the win over Bordeaux, Pochettino said he was “sad” to hear the booing from the crowd and insisted their anger was also felt within the squad.\n    \n\n    \n            “We were all affected,” he said. “We understand the disappointment and the frustration.

Now he says he would settle for continuing to feel safe using its cruise control. \n    \n\n    \n            Morris is one of hundreds of Tesla owners claiming that the automaker’s cruise control has deteriorated and turned dangerous in the last year on some models. They’ve filed complaints with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which opened an investigation last month.  \n    \n\n    \n            In the complaints, the owners say they’ve nearly been rear-ended after their vehicles brake unexpectedly, which they call “phantom braking.” Many say they have stopped using cruise control because they’re afraid it will trigger a crash. Some drivers have said on social media and in interviews with CNN Business that the cruise control issues have them questioning when or if Tesla will deliver self-driving vehicles, which tech and auto companies have promised for years.   \n    \n\n    \n            Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 that self-driving Teslas were probably either a year or two away. More recently, he’s said that self-driving will be a reality this year, even as the automaker continues to describe its more basic driver-assist feature “traffic-aware cruise control,” as a beta feature almost seven years after its launch. (Beta is Silicon Valley lingo for an unfinished and imperfect product.) \n    \n\n    \n            “They’re burning up a lot of good will with not being transparent,” Morris told CNN Business. “People are starting to realize, ‘My car may actually never drive itself.’” \n    \n\n    \n            Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Morris, a software engineer in Indiana, describes Teslas as “the ultimate gadget.” He grew excited in recent years after hearing Musk’s talk of Teslas driving themselves. \n    \n\n    \n            “I wanted to make sure I got a Tesla with all the bells and whistles, and ‘full self-driving’ was one of them,” Morris said, referring to a Tesla driver-assist feature that is expected to eventually be able to drive the vehicle. For now, “full self-driving” requires an attentive driver behind the wheel, and has only been released to a limited number of Tesla drivers, who have described significant issues. \n    \n\n    \n            Morris said he was happy with his first Tesla, a 2016 Model S. When its warranty ended, he purchased the Model X he still owns today. Then almost a year ago, Morris surprised his wife on Mother’s Day with a Tesla Model Y. \n    \n\n    \n            Morris said shortly before the SUV arrived, Tesla messaged him to say that the radar was being phased out of the automaker’s cruise control. Most automakers rely on radar for adaptive cruise control, which speeds up and slows down the vehicle slightly to keep pace with a vehicle in front of it. (Tesla calls its adaptive cruise control, “traffic-aware cruise control.”) \n    \n\n    \n            Most autonomous vehicle experts favor sensor fusion, in which camera and radar data are combined to sense a car’s surroundings.  \n    \n\n    \n            “It’s like pairing one A student with another A student,” said Steven Hong, vice president of radar technology at Ambarella, which is combining radar and camera in a driver-assist system. “Put them together and you’ll get an A+ on your perception project as they cover each other’s weaknesses.” \n    \n\n    \n            Cameras can struggle in poor lighting conditions whereas radar functions even if there is rain, fog, or mud covering the vehicle, he said. \n    \n\n    \n            Trouble for Morris began not long after the Model Y arrived, he said.

But it’s also hard to believe that people will rush into Russia anytime soon,” Sen Sharma told CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea. The BRICS could become the TICKS. \n    \n\n    \n            He added that Poland, Turkey and Mexico are intriguing, as are the Philippines and Indonesia. You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets. “People love their acronyms,” Sen Sharma joked.\n    \n\n    \n            Of course, any emerging market in Europe — think Poland —  is inherently risky because of how close it is geographically to Russia and Ukraine. So other Central and Eastern European nations may be a hard sell for Western investors.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Other experts argue that investors are looking more at individual companies in emerging markets and less at the countries themselves.\n    \n\n    \n            “A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks. It’s a piece of a portfolio,” said Callie Cox, US investment analyst at eToro.\n    \n\n    \n            “The emerging markets landscape has been changing for awhile,” Cox added, noting that many investors have been skeptical of Russia since its annexation of Crimea in 2014. “There has been more anxiety.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 3693, 'description': 'For many years, the world’s most popular emerging markets have been the so-called BRICS: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220314115115-moscow-stock-market-0228.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-15T09:57:36Z', 'keywords': ['business', ' economy and trade', ' economic development', ' emerging markets', ' trade and development', ' banking', ' finance and investments', ' continents and regions', ' eastern europe', ' europe', ' financial markets and investing', ' russia', ' russia-ukraine conflict', ' securities trading', ' stock markets', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war', ' economic indicators', ' economy and economic indicators', ' stock indexes'], 'summary': ['It seems likely that Russia will not be included in top emerging markets funds anytime soon.', '“Some investors are asking about exposure to Russia in emerging markets funds.', 'Don’t invest in emerging markets based on an acronym,” Winograd said.', '“Will investors ever embrace Russia again?', 'Sen Sharma said some investors may start to look at other emerging markets to replace Russia, such as Taiwan and South Korea.', 'You could dub Mexico, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey the MIST markets.', '“A typical investor sees emerging markets as a class of stocks.'], 'sentiment': {'score': -2, 'comparative': -0.003676470588235294, 'calculation': [{'anxiety': -2}, {'skeptical': -2}, {'hard': -1}, {'risky': -2}, {'love': 3}, {'hard': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'embrace': 1}, {'forget': -1}, {'strange': -1}, {'exclude': -1}, {'clear': -1}, {'assets': 2}, {'top': 2}, {'big': 1}, {'invasion': -1}, {'leading': 2}, {'shares': 1}, {'stop': -1}, {'invasion': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'popular': 3}], 'postive': ['love', 'embrace', 'assets', 'top', 'big', 'leading', 'shares', 'popular'], 'negative': ['anxiety', 'skeptical', 'hard', 'risky', 'hard', 'no', 'forget', 'strange', 'exclude', 'clear', 'invasion', 'stop', 'invasion', 'no']}}"

Valieva became the teenage faces of the Winter Olympics, but their memories of Beijing 2022 are likely to be wildly different.\n    \n\n    \n            San Francisco native Gu is now a two-time gold-medalist, the Olympics’ youngest ever freestyle skiing champion, a Chinese national hero – and a budding author.\n    \n\n    \n            Born and raised in California, Gu chose to compete for China in 2019 – where her mother was born – and became the first freestyler skier in history to win three medals at a Games, winning gold in both the halfpipe and big air events.\n    \n\n    \n            “I’m writing a book,” Gu told reporters on Saturday. “I’ve been writing diaries for years because I knew that the way I grew up was different, interesting and special, I’d like to share it with everyone in the future.”\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Hailed as the “pride of China” after winning her first gold, Gu has since won more medals than anyone else for the country at the Games.\n    \n\n    \n            But Gu doesn’t view her achievements at Beijing 2022 as purely a personal achievement – they also serve a greater representational purpose, according to the 18-year-old.\n    \n\n    \n            “Extreme sports, we all know, are heavily dominated by men and stereotypically it has not had the kind of representation and sporting equity that it should,” said Gu.\n    \n\n    \n            “So I think that as a young biracial woman, it is super important to be able to reach those milestones and to be able to push boundaries – not only my own boundaries but those of the sport and those of the record books because that’s what paves the past for the next generation of girls.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Known as Gu Ailing in China, even before the Olympics the young star’s face was everywhere in the country – splashed across billboards, commercials, magazine covers and on state television in the build up to a home Games.\n    \n\n    \n            Given her success at Bejing 2022, her sky-high popularity unsurprisingly continued to rocket.\n    \n\n    \n            “If you see yourself in the sport, it totally changes your perception of what you can do in it,” Gu added.\n    \n\n    \n            “So my biggest goal is one, to have fun for myself, but also to break the boundaries of the boxes that people get put in.”\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            By contrast, Valieva leaves Beijing under the cloud of an ongoing drugs test scandal and a “traumatizing” final skating performance.\n    \n\n    \n            The 15-year-old Russian figure skater was touted to dazzle at the Winter Olympic and she did – making history as she became the first woman to land a quad at the Games.\n    \n\n    \n            However, a day after she helped the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to gold in the team event the Russian teenager was suspended.\n    \n\n    \n            The suspension on February 8 came after it was discovered that Valieva had tested positive for banned heart drug trimetazidine in December 2021, though the result was only analyzed and reported to the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) in February.\n    \n\n  \n  \n    Kamila Valieva: What happens next?\n  \n\n    RUSADA needs to determine what – if any – sanctions to impose on Valieva as the initial suspension was only provisionalIf sanctions are imposed, WADA must decide whether or not to appeal the decisionIf WADA appeals, the case will be heard by CAS, which will make the final decision on the figure skating team event medalsOnly then will the IOC be able to award the fmedals for the team event\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Valieva was subsequently cleared to compete in the individual figure skating event, but a dominant start ended in tears after she fell multiple times during the deciding free skate routine to finish outside the podium places in fourth on Thursday. \n    \n\n    \n            After the 15-year-old left the rink in tears, former US Olympic figure skater Polina Edmunds described the experience as “very traumatizing” for the youngster.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Edmunds’ discomfort was echoed by International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, who said he was “very, very disturbed” when watching Valieva’s performance on TV.\n    \n\n    \n            “How high the pressure on her must have been,” Bach told reporters during a media conference on Friday.\n    \n\n    \n            “This pressure is beyond my imagination, in particular for a girl of 15 years old. To see her struggling on the ice, seeing how she tries to compose herself again. How she tries to finish her program.\n    \n\n    \n            “In every movement in the body language … you could feel that this is an immense, immense mental stress and maybe she would’ve preferred just to leave the ice. And try to leave this story behind her.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Bach also said that he did not have “much confidence in the closest entourage of Kamila,” remarking he noticed “how she was received … with what appeared to be a tremendous coldness, it was chilling to see this.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Rather than giving her comfort. Rather than to try to help her … you could feel this chilling atmosphere. This distance. And if you were interpreting the body language of them, it got even worse because this was even some kind of dismissive gestures.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has pushed back at Bach’s comments, saying that while he respected his opinion, he did not “necessarily agree with him.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Thomas Bach is a very reputable person in sports, he is the head of the International Olympic Committee and, of course, we respect his point of view, but we don’t necessarily agree with him,” Peskov told reporters in a Friday briefing. \n    \n\n    \n            Peskov added that although Bach didn’t like seeing the “tough” tactics at play, “everybody knows that in the sport of great achievements, the toughness of a trainer is the key to victory,” adding, “We can see the athletes achieved these victories.

But it’s not now. I love my teammates, and I love my supportive family. They make it all possible. I’m coming back for my 23rd season in Tampa. Unfinished business LFG.” \n    \n\n    \n            The announcement comes one day after Brady was seen visiting members of the Glazer family, which owns the Buccaneers, at a Manchester United match.\n    \n\n    \n            In February, Brady announced his retirement from the NFL. Brady had just finished his 22nd season in the league – and second with the Buccaneers. \n    \n\n    \n            “We are thrilled that Tom has decided to come back this season. We said we would leave all options open for him should he reconsider his retirement and today’s announcement is something we have been preparing for in recent days,” Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said in a statement. “Tom is the greatest quarterback of all time who is still playing at an elite level. With this decision now made, we will continue to move forward with our offseason plans to reload this roster for another championship run,” Licht added.\n    \n\n    \n            Head coach Bruce Arians said Brady “loves to play football as much as anyone I have ever been around.” \n    \n\n    \n            “He is still playing at a championship level and was as productive as anyone in the league last season. We are ecstatic that he decided to continue playing and working toward winning another championship,” Arians said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            Brady has won seven Super Bowl titles – six with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers – and is the NFL’s all-time leader in passing yards (84,520), touchdown passes (624), completions (7,263), regular season wins (243), playoff wins (35) and Super Bowl MVPs (five). He has also played in and won more regular-season games in his career than any other quarterback.\n    \n\n    \n            Selected 199th overall in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the Patriots, Brady played 20 seasons in Foxborough before leaving New England as a free agent after the 2020 season and signed with the Bucs, where he led the team to a Super Bowl win in his first season there.\n    \n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n"", 'length': 11716, 'description': 'Tom Brady will return to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers next season, the seven-time Super Bowl winner announced Sunday.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220313183740-tom-brady-returns-2022.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-13T23:36:37Z', 'keywords': ['football (american)', ' national football conference', ' nfc south', ' nfl', ' sports and recreation', ' sports figures', ' sports organizations and teams', ' tampa bay buccaneers', ' tom brady', ' afc east', ' american football conference', ' football (american) events', ' new england patriots', ' sports events', ' super bowl'], 'summary': ['Brady confirmed on Twitter that he would be returning from a short retirement.', 'In February, Brady announced his retirement from the NFL.', 'Brady had just finished his 22nd season in the league – and second with the Buccaneers.', '“We are thrilled that Tom has decided to come back this season.', '“Tom is the greatest quarterback of all time who is still playing at an elite level.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 48, 'comparative': 0.06779661016949153, 'calculation': [{'win': 4}, {'super': 3}, {'free': 1}, {'won': 3}, {'super': 3}, {'wins': 4}, {'wins': 4}, {'super': 3}, {'won': 3}, {'winning': 4}, {'ecstatic': 4}, {'greatest': 3}, {'leave': -1}, {'thrilled': 5}, {'united': 1}, {'supportive': 2}, {'love': 3}, {'love': 3}, {'winner': 4}, {'super': 3}, {'protest': -2}, {'protesters': -2}, {'fire': -2}, {'significance': 1}, {'protests': -2}, {'peaceful': 2}, {'devastation': -2}, {'legal': 1}, {'severe': -2}, {'verdict': -1}, {'guilty': -3}, {'big': 1}], 'postive': ['win', 'super', 'free', 'won', 'super', 'wins', 'wins', 'super', 'won', 'winning', 'ecstatic', 'greatest', 'thrilled', 'united', 'supportive', 'love', 'love', 'winner', 'super', 'significance', 'peaceful', 'legal', 'big'], 'negative': ['leave', 'protest', 'protesters', 'fire', 'protests', 'devastation', 'severe', 'verdict', 'guilty']}}"

India, with its vast pool of developers and enthusiastic young population, could be a “superpower in the next five to 10 years,” in cryptocurrency and blockchain industry, he said. \n    \n\n    \n            “What is missing right now is a clear regulatory framework,” he added.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 8412, 'description': 'India has seen a massive boom in cryptocurrency trading since the start of the pandemic, even though authorities in Asia’s third largest economy have for years expressed concerns about digital currencies, and even flirted with a ban.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220217125204-bitcoin-india-cryptocurrency-file.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-03T05:17:39Z', 'keywords': ['asia', ' banking', ' finance and investments', ' bitcoin', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' continents and regions', ' currencies', ' digital currencies', ' economy and economic indicators', ' financial markets and investing', ' financial technology', ' india', ' money', ' banknotes and coins', ' securities trading', ' south asia', ' stock markets', ' technology', ' personal finance'], 'summary': ['Her decision to invest in digital currencies was met with wariness by her family, she recalls.', 'The company says 70% of its 10 million users are between the age of 18 and 34.', 'WazirX also has over 10 million users, and called 2021 a “phenomenal year” for crypto trading in India.', 'This year, however, started on a more cheerful note for enthusiasts.', 'The government also said it would launch a digital rupee in the coming months.', '“Taxation of virtual digital assets or crypto is a step in the right direction.', '“Banning or not banning will come subsequently … But I will tax because it is a sovereign right.”', 'Gupta hopes that the government makes up its mind soon.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 38, 'comparative': 0.03015873015873016, 'calculation': [{'clear': 1}, {'missing': -2}, {'enthusiastic': 3}, {'hopes': 2}, {'shares': 1}, {'gains': 2}, {'deterrent': -2}, {'progress': 2}, {'ban': -2}, {'legal': 1}, {'clear': 1}, {'lack': -2}, {'struggled': -2}, {'optimistic': 2}, {'interest': 1}, {'confidence': 2}, {'clarity': 2}, {'assets': 2}, {'banned': -2}, {'assets': 2}, {'impose': -1}, {'cheerful': 2}, {'excitement': 3}, {'healthy': 2}, {'increase': 1}, {'popular': 3}, {'fallen': -2}, {'frenzy': -3}, {'interest': 1}, {'growing': 1}, {'like': 2}, {'increase': 1}, {'shared': 1}, {'gold': 2}, {'gold': 2}, {'savings': 1}, {'gold': 2}, {'interested': 2}, {'gold': 2}, {'growth': 2}, {'growth': 2}, {'huge': 1}, {'enjoys': 2}, {'boring': -3}, {'savings': 1}, {'increased': 1}, {'regretted': -2}], 'postive': ['clear', 'enthusiastic', 'hopes', 'shares', 'gains', 'progress', 'legal', 'clear', 'optimistic', 'interest', 'confidence', 'clarity', 'assets', 'assets', 'cheerful', 'excitement', 'healthy', 'increase', 'popular', 'interest', 'growing', 'like', 'increase', 'shared', 'gold', 'gold', 'savings', 'gold', 'interested', 'gold', 'growth', 'growth', 'huge', 'enjoys', 'savings', 'increased'], 'negative': ['missing', 'deterrent', 'ban', 'lack', 'struggled', 'banned', 'impose', 'fallen', 'frenzy', 'boring', 'regretted']}}"

The fact that said sounds could be emanating from one of the best basketball players on the planet merely adds to the intrigue.\n    \n\n    \n            When he’s not playing Most Valuable Player-caliber ball for the Philadelphia 76ers – and his definition of “a bad night” was a near triple-double of 26 points, nine rebounds, and seven assists in a 105-87 rout of the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday – five-time NBA All-Star Joel Embiid is rooting for his nation of Cameroon at the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which his homeland happens to be hosting. \n    \n\n    \n            Saturday’s quarterfinal pits the Indomitable Lions against The Gambia in a match Embiid’s team is expected to win. Victory would mean Cameroon is two games away from lifting a sixth AFCON title, with the most recent coming in 2017, the center’s rookie year for the 76ers.\n    \n\n    \n            Embiid was named Eastern Conference Rookie of the Month just three days before Cameroon defeated Egypt 2-1 in the 2017 final; a match-up which, if all things fall into place, could happen again on Sunday, February 6th.\n    \n\n    \n            “The excitement level has always been huge,” Embiid tells CNN Sport’s Amanda Davies about his love of the Cameroon national team dating back to childhood. “The crazy thing is that when Cameroon would always play, anytime they would score, everybody would just scream. You could hear the whole country just scream.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            While his remarkable journey brought Embiid to America at the age of 16 – first via high school and college in Florida and Kansas, and subsequently selected 3rd overall in the 2014 NBA Draft by Philadelphia – he was born a few years after Cameroon’s fairytale run to the quarterfinals of the 1990 World Cup in Italy.\n    \n\n    \n            The first African nation to advance to the last eight, a mere seven minutes away from reaching the final four, Cameroon eventually succumbed to England in extra-time. Along the way, the Indomitable Lions wowed the world, starting with the upset of reigning champion Argentina in the opening match. \n    \n\n    \n            “Obviously, Roger Milla kind of put us on the map,” recalls Embiid about the then 38-year-old striker Milla scoring four times at Italia ’90, gaining further fame for his trademark goal celebration of dancing by the corner flag.\n    \n\n    \n            “Going back through history and watching the games, and learning through the history before I was born, and obviously the celebration was a huge part of that history … we have a lot of history coming from Cameroon, and any time I get the chance to kind of be part of it, I always enjoy.”\n    \n\n    \n            READ: Iranian women allowed to watch landmark moment as Iran qualifies for World Cup\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Embiid believes that the class of 2022 can reign supreme at Africa’s showpiece tournament. “We’re playing at home so any time you’ve got the support from your home fans that usually adds a lot to your motivation to go on and win every single game,” he observes.\n    \n\n    \n            “Playing at home is a huge advantage for us, and I think we’ve got a chance to win it all … I’m excited to keep watching and keep supporting.”\n    \n\n    \n            Cameroon’s success at AFCON notwithstanding, the fortunes of a football team pale in comparison to the deaths which occurred at the Olembe Stadium in Yaoundé last Monday due to a stadium crush. At least eight people were killed and 38 injured during the Round of 16 game between Cameroon and Comoros.\n    \n\n    \n            A somber Embiid says: “I’m a man of God, so I pray for those families to find peace and also for their loved ones to find peace and be at peace. It is tragic that it happened and I’m extremely sorry for it.” Given the horrific events, what would it mean to Embiid and Cameroon if the team does go on to lift the trophy?\n    \n\n    \n            “As a country, we’ve been through a lot,” he reveals. “We haven’t had any competition [held] over there for a long time, so to be able to finally get it and to be able to win, I think is going to be huge for us.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            In the build up to AFCON 2022, there was discussion in some quarters that stars such as Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah (Egypt) and Sadio Mané (Senegal), Manchester City’s Riyad Mahrez (Algeria), Paris Saint-Germain’s Achraf Hakimi (Morocco) and Kalidou Koulibaly (Senegal) temporarily leaving their club sides behind was such a bitter pill for their club sides and supporters to swallow, it overshadowed the prestige which comes from representing one’s country, to say nothing of elevating the tournament to the levels attained across other continents. \n    \n\n    \n            Embiid follows European football closely, so does he concur that AFCON fails to get the credit it deserves on the global stage?\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “It’s messed up,” Embiid quickly concludes. “When it always comes to Africa, I feel like there’s always kind of double standards. I never hear any complaints when it comes to the European Cup or any other cups.\n    \n\n    \n            “[AFCON]’s a little different because obviously it’s going on during the season over there, and some of the best players, when you talk about someone like Mo Salah or Sadio [Mané] they’re supposed to be playing for their clubs. But I also appreciate them wanting to just go back and represent their country, which is good.\n    \n\n    \n            “I think we’re still earning our respect … when you look at the success that Africa has in general, we have a lot of talent. Not just in football but in basketball or other sports too. Over time, we’re going to overcome that but it’s getting there slowly.”\n    \n\n    \n            As for the big man himself, when asked what would mean more to him – Cameroon triumphing at AFCON or Embiid winning MVP – he smiles. “That’s tough! I want both – both would be great!\n    \n\n    \n            “It would have been a better question if you were to ask me between Cameroon winning or me winning a championship!” Asked then which he would prefer, Embiid said, “Both would be great, like I said, I’m a competitor – I want to win.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            After detailing the hard work Cameroon made of their previous opponents Comoros, as the continental minnows played much of the match with 10 men and the entire game with an outfield player in goal, Embiid gives a message to the team of his heart ahead of the challenges which await.\n    \n\n    \n            “Go out there and keep doing whatever they’ve been doing.

The American automaker has a 50% stake in Ford\n            \n                (F) Sollers, a joint venture that employs at least 4,000 workers and is shared with Russian company Sollers.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            The company has plants in St. Petersburg, Elabuga and Naberezhnye Chelny but said it had “significantly wound down” its Russian operations in recent years. The automaker said it was “deeply concerned about the situation in Ukraine,” and noted it has “a strong contingent of Ukrainian nationals working at Ford around the world.”\n    \n\n    \n            General Motors\n            \n                (GM) said it was halting all exports to Russia “until further notice.”\n    \n\n    \n            GM doesn’t have a significant presence there: It sells only about 3,000 vehicles a year through 16 dealerships, according to a spokesperson. That’s out of the more than 6 million vehicles the Detroit-based automaker sells annually.\n    \n\n    \n            Toyota announced it would stop making cars in Russia or importing them to the country “until further notice, due to supply chain disruptions.”\n    \n\n    \n            Volkswagen\n            \n                (VLKAF) is stopping production of vehicles in Russia and has suspended exports to the Russian market. The decision applies to the Russian production sites in Kaluga and Nizhny Novgorod.\n    \n\n    \n            Nissan\n            \n                (NSANF) has suspended the export of vehicles to Russia, adding that it “anticipates that production will stop soon at our plant in St. Petersburg.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Boeing\n            \n                (BA) said it would suspend support for Russian airlines.\n    \n\n    \n            A company spokesperson confirmed the aircraft maker was pausing “parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,” and had also “suspended major operations in Moscow and temporarily closed our office in Kyiv.”\n    \n\n    \n            Airbus\n            \n                (EADSF) followed Boeing with a similar move. In a statement, the company said it has “suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare parts to the country.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Airbnb cofounder and CEO Brian Chesky said in a tweet that his company was suspending all operations in Russia and Belarus.\n    \n\n    \n            Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN)’s cloud division, Amazon\n            \n                (AMZN) Web Services, said March 8 it would halt new sign-ups for the service in Russia and Belarus. The company has already had a “long-standing policy of not doing business with the Russian government” and does not have data centers, infrastructure or offices in Russia, the company said in a blog post.\n    \n\n    \n            “AWS has clear terms of service where if a customer is using AWS services to threaten, incite, promote, or actively encourage violence, terrorism, or other serious harm, they will not be permitted to use our services,” Amazon said. “Any customer we know of who is participating in this type of behavior will have their access to AWS suspended.”\n    \n\n    \n            Apple\n            \n                (AAPL) has stopped selling its products in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            The tech giant said in a statement that it was “deeply concerned” about the Russian invasion. In response, the company has also moved to limit access to digital services, such as Apple Pay, inside Russia, and restricted the availability of Russian state media applications outside the country.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Facebook\n            \n                (FB)-parent Meta said it would block access to Russian news outlets Sputnik and RT, the Russia-backed television network infamous for promoting Russian President Vladimir Putin’s agenda, across the European Union. \n    \n\n    \n            The move comes after the company received “requests from a number of governments and the EU to take further steps in relation to Russian state controlled media,” Nick Clegg, Meta’s VP of global affairs, wrote in a tweet.\n    \n\n    \n            Meta has also said it has applied algorithmic restrictions on Russian state media that should prevent those posts from surfacing as prominently in users’ feeds.\n    \n\n    \n            Hitachi\n            \n                (HTHIY) said March 10 that it is pausing exports to Russia and suspending all manufacturing in the country, “with the exception of products, services and support for electrical power equipment that are indispensable to the daily lives of people,” it said.\n    \n\n    \n            The Japanese conglomerate added that Russia accounts for just a small fraction — roughly 0.5% — of its revenue.\n    \n\n    \n            IBM\n            \n                (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna said the company has suspended all business in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            “In Ukraine, we have been in constant touch with our local teams and continue to provide assistance that includes relocation and financial support,” Krishna said. “The safety and security of IBMers and their families in all areas impacted by this crisis remains our top priority.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Intel\n            \n                (INTC) said April 5 that it has suspended business operations in Russia. Earlier this year, the company said it stopped all shipments to Russia and Belarus. \n    \n\n    \n            Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) said it was suspending all new sales of its products and services in Russia. President and vice-chair Brad Smith also said the company is stopping “many aspects” of its business in Russia in compliance with government sanctions. Microsoft\n            \n                (MSFT) also said it will continue aiding in Ukrainian cybersecurity. \n    \n\n    \n            Netflix\n            \n                (NFLX) said it will be suspending its streaming service in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            “Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia,” a Netflix spokesperson told CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            No other details were provided.\n    \n\n    \n            Previously, the company said it was refusing to air Russian state TV channels — something that the platform would have been required to do starting this week under Russian law.\n    \n\n    \n            “Given the current situation, we have no plans to add these channels to our service,” the company told CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            Nintendo\n            \n                (NTDOF) has stopped taking online orders in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            In a statement on its Russian website, the Switch console maker said that it had “suspended the processing of payments in rubles,” and temporarily set its digital store on “maintenance mode.”\n    \n\n    \n            Roku\n            \n                (ROKU), which sells hardware allowing users to stream content through the internet, has banned RT worldwide.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Sony\n            \n                (SNE) has halted all software and hardware shipments, and temporarily suspended orders on its online PlayStation store in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            The entertainment giant has also paused plans to launch Gran Turismo 7, a driving simulator game, in the country. Sony “joins the global community in calling for peace in Ukraine,” it said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            Spotify\n            \n                (SPOT) said it has closed its office in Russia “indefinitely” and restricted shows “owned and operated by Russian state-affiliated media.” The streaming service removed all content from RT and Sputnik in Europe and other regions, a company spokesman said. \n    \n\n    \n            “We are deeply shocked and saddened by the unprovoked attack on Ukraine,” the spokesman added. “Our first priority over the past week has been the safety of our employees and to ensure that Spotify continues to serve as an important source of global and regional news at a time when access to information is more important than ever.”\n    \n\n    \n            Twitter\n            \n                (TWTR) has similarly announced plans to “reduce the visibility and amplification” of Russian state media content.\n    \n\n    \n            YouTube, which is owned by Google\n            \n                (GOOGL), said it blocked Russian state media within Ukraine, including RT. The video platform also said it would be “significantly limiting recommendations to these channels.” Google\n            \n                (GOOGL) and YouTube have also said they will no longer allow Russian state media outlets to run ads or monetize their content.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Accenture is discontinuing its business in Russia as it “stands with the people of Ukraine,” it said.\n    \n\n    \n            The firm announced the move in a statement on March 3, where it thanked its “nearly 2,300 colleagues in Russia for their dedication and service to Accenture over the years.”\n    \n\n    \n            “We will be providing support to our Russian colleagues,” the company added.\n    \n\n    \n            In a similar move, Deloitte announced on March 7 that it would stop operating in Russia and Belarus. \n    \n\n    \n            “While we know this is the right decision, it will have an impact on Deloitte’s [approximately] 3,000 professionals located in Russia and Belarus. Like others, we know our colleagues in Russia and Belarus have no voice in the actions of their government,” the firm said.\n    \n\n    \n            “We will support all impacted colleagues during this transition and do all we can to assist them during this extremely difficult time.”\n    \n\n    \n            EY, otherwise known as Ernst & Young, also said it would remove its Russian practice from its official global network, but allow it to “continue working with clients as an independent group of audit and consulting companies.”\n    \n\n    \n            “EY in Russia is a team of 4,700 professionals working in 9 cities of the country. The company has been operating in the Russian market for more than 30 years,” it said on March 7.\n    \n\n    \n            “In light of the escalating war, the EY global organization will no longer serve any Russian government clients, state-owned enterprises or sanctioned entities and individuals anywhere in the world.”\n    \n\n    \n            Consulting and accounting firm KPMG International said that its “Russia and Belarus firms will leave the KPMG network.”\n    \n\n    \n            “KPMG has over 4,500 people in Russia and Belarus, and ending our working relationship with them, many of whom have been a part of KPMG for many decades, is incredibly difficult,” the company said. “This decision is not about them – it is a consequence of the actions of the Russian Government. We are a purpose-led and values-driven organization that believes in doing the right thing.”\n    \n\n    \n            PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) is also planning to break away from its Russian business.\n    \n\n    \n            “As a result of the Russian government’s invasion of Ukraine we have decided that, under the circumstances, PwC should not have a member firm in Russia and consequently PwC Russia will leave the network,” the “Big Four” consultancy said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            “Our main focus at PwC continues to be doing all we can to help our Ukrainian colleagues and support the humanitarian efforts,” it added.\n    \n\n    \n            “We are also committed to working with our colleagues at PwC Russia to undertake an orderly transition for the business, and with a focus on the wellbeing of our 3,700 colleagues in PwC Russia.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            BP said it was planning to exit its 19.75% stake in Russia’s biggest oil company, Rosneft, and suspending their joint ventures — which amount to one of the biggest foreign investments in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            Equinor will also begin to exit its joint ventures in Russia, the Norwegian oil and gas company announced.\n    \n\n    \n            “We are all deeply troubled by the invasion of Ukraine, which represents a terrible setback for the world,” said CEO Anders Opedal.\n    \n\n    \n            The company said it had $1.2 billion in long-term investments in Russia at the end of 2021. It has operated in Russia for more than 30 years and has a cooperation agreement with Rosneft.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Exxon pledged to leave its last remaining oil-and-gas project in Russia and not to invest in new developments in the country.\n    \n\n    \n            The Sakhalin-1 venture is “one of the largest single international direct investments in Russia,” according to the project’s website. An Exxon subsidiary has a 30% share, while Rosneft also owns a stake.\n    \n\n    \n            By quitting this project, Exxon would end more than a quarter-century of continuing business presence in Russia.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Rio Tinto\n            \n                (RIO) was the first major mining company to announce it was cutting all ties with Russian businesses.\n    \n\n    \n            “Rio Tinto is in the process of terminating all commercial relationships it has with any Russian business,” a Rio spokesman told Reuters.\n    \n\n    \n            The miner owns an 80% stake in Queensland Alumina Ltd in a joint venture with Russia’s Rusal International, the world’s second-largest aluminum producer. The company did not comment on how its decision to cut ties with Russian businesses would affect Queensland Alumina dealings with Rusal.\n    \n\n    \n            Shell is getting out of Russia and ditching its joint ventures with Gazprom, including its involvement with the moribund Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline.\n    \n\n    \n            The UK-based oil company said on February 28 it would dump its stake in a liquified natural gas facility, its stake in a project to develop fields in western Siberia and its interest in an exploration project in the Gydan peninsula in northwestern Siberia.\n    \n\n    \n            “We are shocked by the loss of life in Ukraine, which we deplore, resulting from a senseless act of military aggression which threatens European security,” Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            Shell has also decided to stop buying Russian oil and gas and will close its service station network.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            TotalEnergies\n            \n                (TOT) also condemned Russia’s actions and said it would no longer provide capital for new projects in the country. \n    \n\n    \n            The French oil giant has done business in Russia for 25 years, and recently helped launch a major liquefied natural gas project on the Siberian coast.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Norway’s $1.3 trillion sovereign wealth fund will divest shares in 47 Russian companies as well as Russian government bonds, the Norwegian prime minister said.\n    \n\n    \n            Mastercard\n            \n                (MA) said it was suspending its network services in Russia. Cards supported by Russian banks will not work in the company’s network, and any cards issued outside of Russia will not work within the country. \n    \n\n    \n            The credit giant, which has operated in Russia for more than 25 years, had previously announced that it had “blocked multiple financial institutions” from its network as a result of anti-Russian sanctions, and would “continue to work with regulators in the days ahead.”\n    \n\n    \n            Visa\n            \n                (V) said it is suspending all of its operations in Russia. It will end all Visa\n            \n                (V) transactions within its borders, and Visa\n            \n                (V) cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside of the country. In addition, all Visa\n            \n                (V) cards worldwide “will no longer work within the Russian Federation,” Visa\n            \n                (V) said. \n    \n\n    \n            American Express\n            \n                (AXP) said in a statement that globally issued American Express\n            \n                (AXP) cards will no longer work in Russia, and cards issued in Russia won’t work outside the country. The company also said it is ending its business operations in Belarus.\n    \n\n    \n            Moody’s said it is suspending commercial operations in Russia. Its investors service will “maintain analytical coverage for existing ratings from outside Russia.”\n    \n\n    \n            Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) became the first major Wall Street bank to announce plans to exit Russia after the invasion of Ukraine. “Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) is winding down its business in Russia in compliance with regulatory and licensing requirements,” a Goldman Sachs\n            \n                (GS) spokesperson told CNN.\n    \n\n    \n            JPMorgan Chase\n            \n                (JPM), America’s largest bank, said it is “actively unwinding” its Russian business and not pursuing any new businesses in the country. JPMorgan cited “compliance with directives by governments around the world” for its decision.\n    \n\n    \n            Western Union\n            \n                (WU) said in a statement that it is suspending operations in Russia and Belarus. “We have thoroughly evaluated internal and external considerations, including the consequences for our valued teammates, partners, and customers,” the company said. “Ultimately, in light of the ongoing tragic impact of Russia’s prolonged assault on Ukraine, we have arrived at the decision to suspend our operations in Russia and Belarus.”\n    \n\n    \n            Citigroup\n            \n                (C) expanded its exit from Russia, saying it’s going to stop soliciting new clients. In pulling out of the country, Citi said it will “include other lines of business and continue to reduce our remaining operations and exposure,” according to a company blog post from Executive Vice President of Global Public Affairs Edward Skyler. Citi noted that pulling its operations “will take time to execute” and that it is assisting multinational corporations.\n    \n\n    \n            PayPal\n            \n                (PYPL) CEO Dan Schulman said the company is suspending services in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            “The PayPal community will remain steadfast in our humanitarian efforts to care for those in Ukraine who are experiencing devastating violence and tragic loss,” Schulman said.\n    \n\n  \n    Food and beverage \n\n\n    \n            AB InBev, the maker of Budweiser and other beer brands, said it has “requested the controlling shareholder” of its Russia operations to suspend the license for the production and sale of Bud in the country. The company said it’s also “forfeiting all financial benefit” from its joint venture operations. Employees will still be paid.\n    \n\n    \n            Burger King said it is pulling corporate support from its businesses in Russia. Restaurant Brands International, which owns the burger chain, said it “has suspended all of its corporate support for the Russian market, including operations, marketing and supply chain.” That doesn’t necessarily mean that Burger King restaurants will be closed in Russia, however, as the company said the chain’s roughly 800 locations there are “fully franchised and managed by a local master franchisee.” This means that the company cannot simply pull the plug on those restaurants as other brands such as McDonald’s have done. \n    \n\n    \n            Coca-Cola\n            \n                (COKE) said that it is “suspending its business in Russia.” The company stated that “our hearts are with the people who are enduring unconscionable effects from these tragic events in Ukraine,” adding that it will monitor the situation as things change.\n    \n\n    \n            Heineken will stop producing and selling beer in Russia. The brewer announced on March 9 that it would “take immediate steps to ring-fence” its Russian business, “to stop the flow of monies, royalties and dividends” out of the country. The beverage giant, which sells into more than 190 countries, had already announced a suspension on new investments and exports to Russia. “We are assessing the strategic options for the future of our Russian operations,” it said in a statement. “We see a clear distinction between the actions of the government and our employees in Russia.”\n    \n\n    \n            McDonald’s is temporarily closing its Russian restaurants. Eighty-four percent of McDonald’ locations in Russia are operated by the company, according to the document. Russia’s restaurants, along with another 108 in Ukraine, all operated by McDonald’s, accounted for 9% of the company’s revenue in 2021.\n    \n\n    \n            Nestle\n            \n                (NSRGF) is suspending all capital investment in Russia and halting advertising in the country. \n    \n\n    \n            “We are working hard to help keep food available to the people, be it on store shelves or through donations of essential foods and beverages like baby food, cereals, soup and noodles to those in need across the region,” the company said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            PepsiCo said it is suspending the sale of Pepsi-Cola and global beverage brands in Russia, but will continue to sell some of its essential products.\n    \n\n    \n            PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said that Pepsi is suspending capital investments, ads and promotional activity in Russia. But PepsiCo will continue to sell some of its products, including baby formula, baby food, milk and other dairy options.\n    \n\n    \n            “We have a responsibility to continue to offer our other products in Russia, including daily essentials,” Laguarta said. “By continuing to operate, we will also continue to support the livelihoods of our 20,000 Russian associates and the 40,000 Russian agricultural workers in our supply chain as they face significant challenges and uncertainty ahead,” he added.\n    \n\n    \n            Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson said that “we have decided to suspend all business activity in Russia,” in a  message to employees. He added that “our licensed partner has agreed to immediately pause store operations and will provide support to the nearly 2,000 [employees] in Russia who depend on Starbucks for their livelihood.” Johnson added that Starbucks is halting shipment of all Starbucks products to Russia. \n    \n\n    \n            Yum Brands\n            \n                (YUM), which has 1,000 KFC and Pizza Hut franchises in Russia, said it would suspend all investment and restaurant development in the country. The company said it would “assess additional options” and redirect all profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian efforts. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Hyatt\n            \n                (H) is halting development in Russia and new investments there following the invasion of Ukraine. Hyatt\n            \n                (H) said it continues to “evaluate hotel operations” in Russia while complying with sanctions and US government directives. \n    \n\n    \n            Hilton\n            \n                (HLT) has shut down its corporate office in Moscow and is suspending all new development activity in Russia, the hotel company announced Wednesday. The moves will not end the Hilton\n            \n                (HLT) brand in Russia, where there are 26 Hilton\n            \n                (HLT) hotels. The company does not own any hotels in Russia. The 26 Hilton\n            \n                (HLT) hotels in Russia are managed or franchised and represent a small percentage of the company’s worldwide footprint of more than 6,800 properties, a spokesperson said. \n    \n\n    \n            Marriott\n            \n                (MAR) has closed its corporate office in Moscow, and paused the opening of upcoming hotels and all future hotel development and investment in Russia. \n    \n\n    \n            “Our hotels in Russia are owned by third parties and we continue to evaluate the ability for these hotels to remain open,” it added.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            3 said it has halted operations in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            Dow\n            \n                (DOW) has suspended all purchases of feedstocks and energy from Russia, and says it “significantly reduced its operations and product offerings” in the country. Dow\n            \n                (DOW) has also stopped all investments in the region, and is only supplying limited essential goods in Russia, including food packaging, hygiene, cleaning and sanitation products and household goods. \n    \n\n    \n            General Electric\n            \n                (GE) suspended most of its operations in Russia, with the exception of “providing essential medical equipment and supporting existing power services.”\n    \n\n    \n            John Deere\n            \n                (DE), the world’s largest agriculture equipment maker, has halted shipments of its products to Russia. A Deere spokesperson said the only equipment produced in Russia is at a small factory in Orenburg, Russia that makes seeding and tillage equipment.\n    \n\n    \n            Caterpillar said on March 9 that it is suspending operations in its Russian manufacturing facilities. \n    \n\n    \n            “Operations in Russia have become increasingly challenging, including supply chain disruptions and sanctions,” the manufacturing giant said in a statement.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            DirecTV is cutting ties with RT.\n    \n\n    \n            A spokesperson for the US satellite carrier told CNN Business that it had already been reviewing whether to renew the outlet’s carriage agreement, which was due to expire later this year. Russia’s war on Ukraine sped up its decision, according to the representative.\n    \n\n    \n            Disney\n            \n                (DIS) is also suspending the release of its theatrical films in Russia, citing “the unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.”\n    \n\n    \n            The entertainment giant had multiple films set for release in Russia in the coming months. That includes Marvel’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” on May 5 and Pixar’s “Lightyear” on June 16.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “We will make future business decisions based on the evolving situation,” a Disney spokesperson said.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            WarnerMedia said on February 28 that it would pause the release of “The Batman” in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            The film is one of the biggest blockbusters of the year, and is being released in most countries by Warner Bros. which, like CNN, is a unit of WarnerMedia.\n    \n\n    \n            A company spokesperson said that the decision was made “in light of the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,” and that the company hoped “for a swift and peaceful resolution to this tragedy.”\n    \n\n    \n            WarnerMedia is also pausing all new business in Russia, ceasing broadcast of its channels, halting all new content licensing with Russian entities, and pausing planned theatrical and games releases. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Crocs \n            \n                said March 9 that it will “pause its direct-to-consumer business, inclusive of e-commerce and retail operations, in Russia.” It will also pause “the importation of goods into the country.”\n    \n\n    \n            Estée Lauder Companies said March 7 that it will “suspend all commercial activity in Russia, including closing every store we own and operate, as well as our brand sites and shipments to any of our retailers in Russia.” The company had already suspended business investments and initiatives in Russia, it said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            Fast Retailing announced March 10 that it was suspending Uniqlo’s business activities in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            The turnaround came just days after Tadashi Yanai, CEO of the Japanese group, vowed to keep operating there, calling clothing a basic human necessity. \n    \n\n    \n            Now, “it has become clear to us that we can no longer proceed,” Fast Retailing said in a statement, citing “a number of difficulties.”\n    \n\n    \n            The company “is strongly against any acts of hostility,” it added. “We condemn all forms of aggression that violate human rights and threaten the peaceful existence of individuals.”\n    \n\n    \n            H&M\n            \n                (HMRZF) will pause all sales in Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            In a statement, the company said that it was “deeply concerned about the tragic developments in Ukraine, and stands with all the people who are suffering.”\n    \n\n    \n            The clothing giant’s stores in Ukraine are already closed due to safety concerns.\n    \n\n    \n            H&M Group, which operates a number of brands, had 168 stores in Russia as of last November, according to its website.\n    \n\n    \n            Ikea, the world’s largest furniture company, is closing its 17 stores in Russia. The company said the conflict is having a “huge human impact” and is “resulting in serious disruptions to supply chain and trading conditions.” In addition to pausing its retail and manufacturing operations in Russia, it will suspend all trade with the country and its ally, Belarus.\n    \n\n    \n            Ikea said 15,000 workers would be directly affected by the shutdown in the region. The company will continue to pay them, at least for the time being.\n    \n\n    \n            Imperial Brands\n            \n                (IMBBY), one of the world’s largest tobacco players, will sell off its Russian business.\n    \n\n    \n            The company behind Winston and Gauloises cigarettes says its operations in Russia comprise 1,000 employees in sales and marketing, as well as a factory in the city of Volgograd.\n    \n\n    \n            Imperial will “continue to pay their salaries until any transfer is concluded,” it said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            Inditex, the parent company of Zara, said it is pausing operations in Russia and closing 502 stores in the country.

FedEx said it suspended operations to “support the people of Ukraine.” DHL said it has suspended inbound shipments to Russia and Belarus.\n    \n\n    \n            Maersk and MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company are both halting cargo bookings with Russia.\n    \n\n    \n            “As the stability and safety of our operations is already being directly and indirectly impacted by sanctions, new Maersk bookings to and from Russia will be temporarily suspended, with exception of foodstuffs, medical and humanitarian supplies,” the Denmark-based company said in a statement.\n    \n\n    \n            “We are deeply concerned by how the crisis keeps escalating in Ukraine,” the company added.\n    \n\n    \n            MSC, a Swiss-owned container shipping line, said its suspension would cover “all access areas, including Baltics, Black Sea and Far East Russia.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            French train maker Alstom said that it will “suspend all deliveries towards Russia” in a statement on March 9. \n    \n\n    \n            The group is also suspending all future business investments in Russia, it added. \n    \n\n    \n            Alstom owns a 20% stake — as a capital investment — in Transmashholding (TMH), the Russian locomotives and rail equipment provider.\n    \n\n    \n            “There was no material business nor operational link between Alstom and TMH,” the company said. “The book value will be re-assessed as part of the fiscal year 2021/22 closing accounts.”\n    \n\n    \n            — Rishi Iyengar, Michelle Toh, Diksha Madhok, Chris Isidore, Vanessa Yurkevich, Paul P.

It is now estimated the number of extremely poor people in sub-Saharan Africa has crossed the 500 million mark, half the population. \n    \n\n    \n            This in the youngest continent in the world with a median age of 20 and a faster-growing population than anywhere else, further intensifying an already fierce competition for resources.  \n    \n\n    \n            These conditions create fertile conditions for coups and for increasingly desperate young Africans who have lost patience with their corrupt leaders to welcome coupists promising radical change, as was witnessed on the streets of Guinea following the takeover, with some elated Guineans even kissing the soldiers.  \n    \n\n    \n            But as with the coups of the 1970s these scenes of joy will likely be shortlived, says Joseph Sany, Vice President of the Africa Center at the United States Institute of Peace. “The initial reaction of what you see on the streets will be of joy, but very soon, people will be demanding action…  and I’m not sure the military will be able to deliver on the expectations, basic service delivery, more freedoms,” he says.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades. Worryingly, research shows that many Africans are increasingly ceasing to believe elections can deliver the leaders they want. \n    \n\n    \n             Surveys conducted across 19 African countries in 2019/20 showed just 4 in 10 respondents (42%) now believe elections work well to ensure “MPs reflect voters’ views” and to “enable voters remove non-performing leaders.”  \n    \n\n    \n            In other words, less than half believe elections guarantee representativeness and accountability, key ingredients of functional democracies. \n    \n\n    \n            Across 11 countries polled regularly since 2008, the belief elections enable voters remove non-performing leaders has dropped by 11% points among citizens, according to the survey. It is not that Africans no longer want to choose their leaders via elections, it is simply that many now believe their political systems are gamed.  \n    \n\n    \n            Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem. The only reason he was still in power until the coup was because he engineered constitutional changes in 2020 to enable himself serve a third-term as president, a common practise by several leaders on the continent, from Uganda’s Yoweri Museveni to Alassane Ouattara in Côte d’Ivoire.  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            The African Union is rightly condemning Guinea’s coup, but its response to such constitutional abuses has been muted. \n    \n\n    \n            These double standards and perceived elite conspiracies create the perfect environment for young swashbuckling officers like the 41-year-old Doumbouya to step in and promise to save the day. \n    \n\n    \n            “If the people are crushed by their elites, it is up to the army to give the people their freedom,” said Guinea’s new leader, quoting the former Ghanaian president Jerry Rawlings who himself led two coups\n    \n\n    \n            It is perhaps no coincidence Doumbouya quoted the feisty Rawlings, who was very effective at expressing the anger Ghanaians felt towards their political elites when he led military juntas in the 1980s. Desperate citizens living in political systems they often rightly believe are fixed can easily be seduced by anti-elite, anti-corruption rhetoric coupled with the promise of the new. \n    \n\n    \n            We should, unfortunately, prepare ourselves for the eventuality of more coups in Africa in the coming years. They are not to be expected in richer countries with strong institutions such as South Africa, Ghana or Botswana but in the poorer more fragile states. As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred.\n    \n\n    \n             Fifteen of the twenty countries topping the 2021 Fragile States Index are in Africa, including countries like Cameroon, Central African Republic, Somalia and South Sudan as well as larger nations like Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia (which has been experiencing violent internal conflict for close to a year now) and Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            This increasing probability of coups will make Africa in general less predictable and stable, a negative for investors that could end up worsening the economic situation. \n    \n\n    \n            Can this undesirable trend be reversed? Yes, but while the international condemnations of coups in Guinea and elsewhere are crucial as deterrents to other would-be power grabbers, the only actors who truly have the power to reverse this worrying trend are African leaders themselves. \n    \n\n    \n            They are the ones in charge on the ground and it is their response to these recent events that will be the deciding factor. They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans. But if the problems still being cited to justify coups continue to worsen in today’s African democracies, then the temptation to try something else will continue to be dangerously seductive, both for coupists and citizens alike.    \n    \n\n                ', 'length': 8135, 'description': 'In just over a year, Africa has experienced three successful coups (two in Mali and one more recently in Guinea), one unsuccessful coup attempt in Niger, and an arbitrary military transfer of power in Chad following the assassination of its president.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210906094028-03-guinea-coup-0905.jpg?q=x_84,y_365,h_1622,w_2882,c_crop/w_800', 'date': '2021-09-12T12:14:45Z', 'keywords': ['africa', ' continents and regions', ' corruption', ' coups and attempted coups', ' elections and campaigns', ' government and public administration', ' guinea', ' military', ' politics', ' society', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war', ' western africa'], 'summary': ['Furthermore, in many countries, people feel these problems are worsening.', 'One in three people are now unemployed in Nigeria, West Africa’s largest economy.', 'The same goes for South Africa, the most industrialized African nation.', 'What is clear is that these coups pose a serious threat to the democratic gains African countries have made in recent decades.', 'Leaders like the deposed Conde are part of the problem.', 'As are Mali, Niger, Chad and now Guinea where coups and coup attempts have recently occurred.', 'Can this undesirable trend be reversed?', 'They need to reignite the belief democracy can deliver for Africans.'], 'sentiment': {'score': -37, 'comparative': -0.03192407247627265, 'calculation': [{'dangerously': -2}, {'worsen': -3}, {'problems': -2}, {'worrying': -3}, {'yes': 1}, {'undesirable': -2}, {'worsening': -3}, {'negative': -2}, {'stable': 2}, {'conflict': -2}, {'violent': -3}, {'like': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'poorer': -2}, {'strong': 2}, {'promise': 1}, {'seduced': -1}, {'desperate': -3}, {'anger': -3}, {'effective': 2}, {'no': -1}, {'freedom': 2}, {'crushed': -2}, {'save': 2}, {'promise': 1}, {'like': 2}, {'perfect': 3}, {'abuses': -3}, {'problem': -2}, {'like': 2}, {'want': 1}, {'no': -1}, {'dropped': -1}, {'guarantee': 1}, {'ensure': 1}, {'want': 1}, {'gains': 2}, {'threat': -2}, {'clear': 1}, {'freedoms': 2}, {'demanding': -1}, {'joy': 3}, {'peace': 2}, {'united': 1}, {'joy': 3}, {'elated': 3}, {'welcome': 2}, {'corrupt': -3}, {'lost': -3}, {'desperate': -3}, {'fertile': 2}, {'poor': -2}, {'unemployed': -1}, {'worsened': -3}, {'tragic': -2}, {'poverty': -1}, {'corrupt': -3}, {'defenders': 2}, {'active': 1}, {'corruption': -3}, {'negative': -2}, {'fighting': -2}, {'poor': -2}, {'corruption': -3}, {'worsening': -3}, {'problems': -2}, {'poverty': -1}, {'corruption': -3}, {'failed': -2}, {'successful': 3}, {'threaten': -2}, {'assassination': -3}, {'unsuccessful': -2}, {'successful': 3}], 'postive': ['yes', 'stable', 'like', 'like', 'strong', 'promise', 'effective', 'freedom', 'save', 'promise', 'like', 'perfect', 'like', 'want', 'guarantee', 'ensure', 'want', 'gains', 'clear', 'freedoms', 'joy', 'peace', 'united', 'joy', 'elated', 'welcome', 'fertile', 'defenders', 'active', 'successful', 'successful'], 'negative': ['dangerously', 'worsen', 'problems', 'worrying', 'undesirable', 'worsening', 'negative', 'conflict', 'violent', 'poorer', 'seduced', 'desperate', 'anger', 'no', 'crushed', 'abuses', 'problem', 'no', 'dropped', 'threat', 'demanding', 'corrupt', 'lost', 'desperate', 'poor', 'unemployed', 'worsened', 'tragic', 'poverty', 'corrupt', 'corruption', 'negative', 'fighting', 'poor', 'corruption', 'worsening', 'problems', 'poverty', 'corruption', 'failed', 'threaten', 'assassination', 'unsuccessful']}}"

According to a company survey carried out in Helsinki, 12% of its users said that Whim had prompted them to give up their cars. “People want the more sustainable solution,” he says, “but they still want the freedom of being able to go anywhere, anytime.”\n    </p>\n\n                </div></div>', 'text': '\n       \n    \n                    \n      London\n      CNN Business\n        \xa0—\xa0\n    \n\n\n    \n            City dwellers are used to switching between apps to decide the best way to get from A to B. Is it quickest to get the train or the bus? What about a taxi or a city bike? Which provider has the nearest e-scooter?\n    \n\n    \n            It can be inconvenient and time consuming. Which is why Finnish startup MaaS Global decided to aggregate all these services into one app called Whim. Available in more than 10 cities across Europe and Asia, users can access taxis, buses, bikes, e-scooters and rental cars. \n    \n\n    \n            “Whim’s sole purpose is to compete against car ownership,” CEO Sampo Hietanen tells CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            According to the International Energy Agency, transport is responsible for 24% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, most of which come from passenger vehicles. If Whim can persuade users to trade their car keys for a single app offering multiple transport options, the environmental impact could be enormous, says Hietanen. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            He admits this isn’t an easy task. To succeed Whim has to be more convenient and cheaper than owning a car. “The car represents freedom of mobility,” says Hietanen — even if a city dweller barely uses it, they still keep it parked outside as a “freedom insurance.”\n    \n\n    \n            To compete, Whim offers rental cars and taxis, but Hietanen says that users tend to opt for public transport or micromobility (shared lightweight vehicles such as bikes or e-scooters). \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Users can choose between multiple tiers of service, including a pay-as-you-go option and a 30-day season ticket, which costs €62 ($73) in Helsinki — where the app is most established — for unlimited public transport and short taxi rides. The ticket also offers car rental from €55 ($65) per day.\n    \n\n    \n            While Helsinki has well-developed alternatives to driving, that’s not true of everywhere. If a city “does not have a wide public transport system or a lot of rental cars or taxis in place” then it will be difficult to convince people to give up their cars, says Maria Kamargianni, associate professor of transport and energy at University College London.\n    \n\n    \n            She says apps like Whim represent the first step in tempting people away from car ownership, and adds that the availability of alternative transport options is likely to improve as the market matures. Research firm MarketsandMarkets predicts the global mobility service market will grow from $4.7 billion in 2020 to $70.4 billion by 2030. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Other providers include Citymapper, which launched a travel pass for Londoners in 2019, and Moovit, which launched an all-in-one mobility app in Israel last year. \n    \n\n    \n            Whim, launched in 2016, is one of the earliest providers and has raised more than $60 million from investors such as BP\n            \n                (BP), Mitsubishi\n            \n                (MBFJF) and Toyota Financial Services.

But another economic indicator is starting to look ominous: The yield curve is flattening.\n    \n\n    \n            Wall Street closely watches the difference, or spread, between short-term government bond yields, most notably the 2-year Treasury, and longer-term bond rates like the 10-year Treasury. \n    \n\n    \n            As that spread diminishes, investors worry that the yield curve could eventually invert, meaning that short-term rates would be higher than long-term yields. As of Friday, the difference was just 0.25%, with the 10-year yield at around 2% and the 2-year yielding 1.75%. \n    \n\n    \n            The gap widened a bit Monday, as the 10-year rose to 2.1% and the 2-year yield was up to about 1.82%, making the spread 0.28%.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            An inverted yield curve has often been a potential recession signal. The yield curve inverted in 2019 before the 2020 Covid-induced recession. It also did so in 2007 before the 2008 Global Financial Crisis/Great Recession. And it inverted in early 2000 right before the dot-com/tech stock meltdown.\n    \n\n    \n            US Labor Secretary Marty Walsh told CNN’s Poppy Harlow that a recession is “a real likelihood” but he added that “we have a very strong economy” and noted that the job market in particular is healthy.\n    \n\n    \n            When investors want higher rates for short-term bonds, it’s an indication that bondholders are nervous. Typically, rates for long-term bonds are higher because you have to wait longer to get paid back. \n    \n\n    \n            So how worried should investors be that the yield curve might invert?\n    \n\n    \n            Some argue that the only reason this is happening is because of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting spike in commodity prices. \n    \n\n    \n            “The risks of a recession are building but not necessarily immediate unless the global geopolitics dramatically deteriorate from this delicate starting point,” Jim Reid, a strategist with Deutsche Bank, said in a report.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            The Federal Reserve, which is widely expected to raise interest rates later this week, may be careful to not raise rates so aggressively that short-term yields increase even further and wind up flipping the yield curve. \n    \n\n    \n            That could cause a slowdown in the job market. And the Fed is supposed to keep an eye on unemployment rates as well as inflation.\n    \n\n    \n            “Chair [Jerome] Powell will make it clear that the Fed is aware of its dual mandate and does not want to invert the yield curve and produce a recession,” Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said in a report.  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Although geopolitical tension could be distorting prices, inflation pressures were already building before the Russian attack on Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            “Russia/Ukraine is only pulling forward the natural slowing in the economy that would have occurred as the Fed tightened policy,” said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note last week. \n    \n\n    \n            Essaye argues that Fed rate hikes and a slowing economy would have likely led to an inverted yield curve at some point later this year even if Russia and Ukraine weren’t in the headlines.\n    \n\n    \n            “The looming rate hikes (which are still coming) will combine with the growth slowing impulse of higher commodity prices and higher inflation to bring a sooner than previously expected slowing of growth,” he said.\n    \n\n    \n            Rising short-term rates could also create problems for large Wall Street firms. Although higher rates tend to boost profits for loans, they also make trading, particularly for bonds, more of a gamble. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “The recent flattening of the yield curve and volatility in capital markets are emerging risks; thus, we are more cautious on the largest banks,” analysts at research firm KBW said in a recent report.\n    \n\n    \n            The fact that bond yields are low isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Rates fall when investors are buying bonds. So traders are clearly still finding US Treasury debt to be stable enough to keep flocking to it. But it is unusual to see short-term rates fall this sharply.\n    \n\n    \n            One strategist noted that it doesn’t matter if investors are buying bonds because they perceive them to be safe. There is still a lot to worry about. \n    \n\n    \n            “The recession drumbeat is gaining in volume,” Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, said in a report. “Of course there are many reasons to be concerned.

In fact, eight African countries sent athletes to South Korea four years ago, a record number. \n    \n\n    \n            But just five African countries participated in this year’s Games, where the medal tables were dominated by athletes from Europe, North America and Asia. \n    \n\n    \n            European and North American dominance in the Winter Games can in part be explained by the fact that their climates, where ice and snow are more plentiful, lend themselves to winter sports.  \n    \n\n    \n            But climate isn’t the only factor affecting Olympic participation – when it comes to representation at the Winter Games, there is also a huge gap between wealthier and poorer nations. \n    \n\n    \n            At PyeongChang 2018, no athlete from Africa, Central or South America won a medal, while Norway – one of the world’s wealthiest countries but with a population of just about five million – topped the medal table as it did at Beijing 2022.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            The International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it “aims to make success at the Games achievable by everyone.”  \n    \n\n    \n            It allocates a “substantial portion” of profit from the Games to athletes and coaches through individual National Olympic Committees (NOCs) as part of the Olympic Solidarity Plan to help “athletes and coaches from countries with the greatest financial need.” \n    \n\n    \n            Some 429 athletes from 80 NOCs were awarded scholarships ahead of Beijing to “support qualification efforts,” according to the IOC. But European athletes nabbed nearly 69% of 429 scholarships awarded by the IOC before the Beijing Games. African athletes took home around 4% of those 429 scholarships. \n    \n\n    \n            Only NOCs “whose athletes had a proven winter sports track record” had access to the program, the IOC said. \n    \n\n    \n            Meanwhile, 236 athletes (139 men and 97 women) who received these individual athlete scholarships eventually qualified to take part in the Games.  \n    \n\n    \n            Athletes in Europe benefited the most from these scholarships, receiving more than $5 million. Athletes in Asia received $955,003, the Americas $944,917, Oceania got $441,000 and Africa $177,000. \n    \n\n\n    \n            Scholarships make up just a part of Olympic Solidarity assistance programs designed jointly by the IOC and NOCs, which also direct funds – derived from Olympic revenue – towards training of coaches, sports administrators and promoting the Olympic values, according to the IOC.  \n    \n\n    \n            CNN has reached out to the IOC for a further breakdown of funding. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            On a national level, the composition of delegations often isn’t very racially diverse. \n    \n\n    \n            “There have been Black medalists from the US and Canada and from Germany. I don’t know of any other Black medalists except for those three countries,” Olympic historian Bill Mallon told CNN Sport. \n    \n\n    \n            Black athletes have proven crucial to Team USA’s Olympic and Paralympic success in the Summer Games.  \n    \n\n    \n            But even as Black athletes won medals at Beijing – speedskater Erin Jackson brought home gold, while bobsledder Elana Meyers Taylor became the most decorated Black athlete in Winter Olympics history – White athletes still made up the majority of Team USA at the Games this year. \n    \n\n    \n            Prior to Beijing, the US has only had around 25 Black representatives on all of their various Winter Olympic teams, with over half of them in bobsledding, according to Mallon.  \n    \n\n    \n            In 1988, Debi Thomas became Team USA’s first Black Olympic Winter medalist, winning bronze in the ladies’ figure skating competition, and Vonetta Flowers became the first Black athlete to ever win gold in the Winter Games, when she drove to victory in the two-woman bobsled with Jill Bakken in 2002. \n    \n\n    \n            Hockey player Jarome Iginla became the first Black man to win gold at the same Games when Canada triumphed over the US. \n    \n\n    \n            Four years later, speedskater Shani Davis became the first African American athlete to win an individual gold medal in Turin, Italy. \n    \n\n    \n            Overall, there have been a relatively small number of Black figure skaters, and they have rarely excelled at the Olympic level. Though she demonstrated technical excellence in her routines, Black French skater Surya Bonaly never won an Olympic medal.  \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Bonaly performed a one-bladed backflip at the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics – an illegal move that was perceived as an act of defiance to the judges – which she landed on one foot.  \n    \n\n    \n            That move is still illegal and has never been tried since in an Olympic competition.\n    \n\n    \n            “They want to keep the girls pretty, in a special way,” Bonaly told CNN Sport as she reflected on her career. Though now, according to Bonaly, “people are changing and trying to challenge themselves, and try to have more personality in their own style. And that’s good. And it’s more accepted.”\n    \n\n    \n            Bonaly added: “Now, back then … you only came from one mold, one way.”\n    \n\n    \n            Black athletes are now prevalent in sliding sports: African American women comprise a majority of America’s Olympic bobsled team. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Asian American athletes, including figure skater Nathan Chen and snowboarder Chloe Kim, have also had a commanding presence at this year’s Games. \n    \n\n    \n            Four of the six Team USA singles figure skaters were Asian American: Karen Chen, Nathan Chen, Alysa Liu and Vincent Zhou. Madison Chock competed in the ice dancing event, while Abby Roque was the first Indigenous women’s hockey player in US team history.  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Experts say that economics – not just talent – plays a huge part in whether athletes are able to participate in the Olympics. \n    \n\n    \n            “That notion of economics is very key because we’re looking at sports such as skiing, bobsledding, figure skating – and that equipment alone costs so much,” Akilah Carter-Francique, executive director of the Institute for the Study of Sport, Society and Social Change at San Jose State University told CNN Sport.  \n    \n\n    \n            “Pay to play is not accessible to anyone but people with money,” Shireen Ahmed, senior contributor with CBC Sports, told CNN. \n    \n\n    \n            “It becomes not just a racialized issue, it’s a class issue, and those two things go hand-in-hand. Not everybody’s going to be a working-class hero,” she said.  \n    \n\n    \n            With stories of parents remortgaging their homes, working long hours and reducing expenses to facilitate their children’s Olympic dreams, it comes as no surprise that financial barriers in winter sports can be prohibitive.  \n    \n\n    \n            Ghana’s first skeleton Olympian Akwasi Frimpong told CNN Sport that competing at an elite level costs around $250,000 a year, which would pay for a dedicated full-time sliding coach, a push coach, a strength and conditioning coach, physical therapist, a mechanic, sliding equipment, hotel, air travel, ground transportation and food.  \n    \n\n    \n            “This does not include also having a family and a mortgage to pay,” he said, adding that sliding sports athletes would expect to pay $80,000 to compete in smaller, non-Olympic events, outside of the Olympic season. \n    \n\n    \n            Jamaica’s first Olympic alpine skier Alexander told CNN: “I’m competing with people that have been skiing since the age of two, ski racing since the age of four, and their parents have put $50,000 a year into their improvements while they were young.”  \n    \n\n    \n            “And now, their national ski federation or local club is putting in $150,000-250,000 a year for their advancement,” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            In 2020, 58% of nearly 500 athletes surveyed by the athletes’ rights group Global Athlete said they did not consider themselves financially stable. \n    \n\n    \n            The athletes who participated in the survey hailed from 48 countries. 44% were actively competing with sport as their primary profession and 31% of the athletes were Olympians.  \n    \n\n    \n            Shiva Keshavan, a six-time Olympian and India’s only Olympic competitor in luge in the 2018 Winter Games told CNN that European delegations, which have a better system of recruitment and employment for athletes, dominate Olympic winter sports.  \n    \n\n    \n            “Athletes that come from developing sport nations generally have more of a challenge because you don’t have the systems in place that enable a successful career. \n    \n\n    \n            “Often, athletes are having to deal with training with less, with worse equipment or having to do their own logistics and, sometimes, without a coach,” he added. \n    \n\n    \n            Many elite skiers, snowboarders and ice skaters take expensive private lessons, hire coaches or attend private schools to facilitate their training as they’re growing up.  \n    \n\n    \n            Bode Miller – the most decorated US Olympic skier, with one gold, three silver and two bronze medals – attended Carrabassett Valley Academy in Maine on a scholarship and said in 2021 that he “wouldn’t have been able to go if not for generous people in my small town of Franconia.” \n    \n\n    \n            Parents with means can expect to pay as much as $64,050 to send their children to the academy, which boasts that it has “earned more Olympic medals for skiing and snowboarding than some small countries.”  \n    \n\n    \n            Privately educated athletes constituted 30.3% of athletes who participated in the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, according to a 2017 study published in the journal Public Health.\n    \n\n    \n            The study analyzed sociodemographic data for all athletes representing Canada, the US, Great Britain and Australia in Sochi. 94.9% of winter athletes were White.  \n    \n\n    \n            “If your parents ski, almost certainly, you will ski,” Alexander told CNN. \n    \n\n    \n            “If we look at minorities in America or in England, most of them are first- or second-generation immigrants, so they don’t have as much disposable income as their White counterparts,” Alexander said. \n    \n\n    \n            Adding that he doesn’t think” winter sports are racist at all,” Alexander says diversity will continue to grow in winter sports. \n    \n\n    \n            “I just think that as more and more minorities get equal treatment, get equal pay, and as more and more minorities spread out from urban centers by virtue of technology … then I believe the tide will turn.” \n    \n\n    \n            In a statement sent to CNN, the IOC said it “fully supports diversity and inclusion in the Olympic Games, as well as clear and fair qualification systems that apply equally to all athletes wishing to qualify for the Olympic Games.”  \n    \n\n    \n            “We have to strike a balance between attracting the best athletes in the world and universality,” it added.\n    \n\n    \n            “Some sports in all reality are more accessible,” James Macleod, IOC Director of Olympic Solidarity and National Olympic Committees Relations told CNN Sport, referencing running the 100 meters.  \n    \n\n    \n            “But you can’t sail a sailing boat tomorrow, unless you’ve got access to one, or ride a horse or ski down a mountain. And there’s factors in that that are socio-economic, that are political, that are climate driven,” he said.  \n    \n\n    \n            “And that’s not something that us at the IOC are going to change.  \n    \n\n    \n            “All sports have different levels of access,” Macleod said, adding that this is something the international federations of each sport “tries to look at.” \n    \n\n    \n            The IOC said that qualification systems are developed and put in place by international federations “to ensure a fair and credible process for athletes to qualify for the Olympic Games according to their sports’ structures and priorities.”  \n    \n\n    \n            “Collectively, the qualification systems allow diversity at the Olympic Winter Games, however, this is not necessarily reflected at each discipline level in every sport,” it added.  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Winter sports infrastructure is well established in some parts of Asia – notably in Japan, South Korea and China. But it remains an “unexplored market” in India, Keshavan said.  \n    \n\n    \n            “For India, a country that has a lot more natural resources for winter sports, compared to China, or Japan or Korea because of the Himalayan Mountain range, it is a big opportunity.  \n    \n\n    \n            “We don’t really have the kind of infrastructure: ski resorts, big sports facilities,” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            This year, a single athlete, Mohammad Arif Khan, represented India’s nearly 1.4 billion people, having qualified in the slalom and giant slalom events.  \n    \n\n    \n            Khan finished 45th in the giant slalom. India has never won a medal at the Winter Games and does not have a prominent winter sports federation, Keshavan told CNN Sport. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “Of course, it is more difficult for athletes from these countries to train at an elite level because you need access to a certain standard of ice quality which is maintained. You need to have modified slopes, you need to have certain equipment,” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            “Skiers from India and Pakistan, even all over Southeast Asia, Oceania, have to travel and go to Europe for training,” he added. \n    \n\n    \n            Athletes and politicians alike are hopeful that South Asia will become a winter sports destination: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan recently expressed optimism that the northern city of Skardu would turn into a world winter sports destination in years to come. \n    \n\n    \n            Frimpong, the Olympian from Ghana, told CNN that people don’t necessarily see the lack of diversity in winter sports as illogical because many countries get little to no snow. \n    \n\n    \n            “But that doesn’t matter,” he explained. For six months of the year, skeleton athletes can train in pushing the sled, he said.\n    \n\n    \n            “You can do most of that in your own country in Africa. We do track and field training, we do weightlifting, I’ll be able to test for three, four months at a time in areas where there are tracks. It’s not like it’s impossible,” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            “Infrastructure is not something that the IOC invests in,” Macleod told CNN adding: “That’s within the remit of the national government.” \n    \n\n    \n            “Often, when we have this discussion about African participation and in winter sports, the reality is that within African countries, there is not the infrastructure,” Macleod said. \n    \n\n    \n            “We as the IOC are not going to start building ice rinks across Africa – that is not something that is in our mission. That has to come through the national governments, but the programs that we offer are grassroots and talent identification programs,” he added. \n    \n\n    \n            “Each of the 206 National Olympic Committees in the world has different priorities. When a NOC looks at our programs or looks at their own development opportunities, they will say, ‘Actually, we’re not going to invest in winter sports because that’s not a priority for us.’\n    \n\n    \n            “‘We’re going to invest in athletics, rowing or whatever.’ And they will always have to make that choice of where they’re going to put their funding and what programs from our side they’re going to apply for,” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            “We put at the disposal of our stakeholders – whether it’s NOCs or the IFs (international federations) – a range of opportunities, but we are not going to go into a country and say this has got to be your priority. They are going to decide on their own priorities,” he said. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Carter-Francique told CNN that while the Olympics is billed as an opportunity for all to participate, this is not reflected in delegations’ final offerings.  \n    \n\n    \n            “For many, the key to involvement in a particular sport is seeing yourself,” she added.  \n    \n\n    \n            In winter sports especially, there are a lack of development programs to encourage underserved communities to participate, said Carter-Francique. \n    \n\n    \n            “If you don’t see yourself as a representative in that space, the likelihood that you would push to try to enter a space and be the first or be the only is one that not many people would do,” she added. \n    \n\n    \n            Some sports, like soccer, basketball, and even tennis, are more accessible because training facilities and equipment can be cheaper, Carter-Francique said. \n    \n\n    \n            “But the opportunity to access a ski resort, a figure skating rink, a bobsled facility – and have the bobsled – is very limited in general,” she added. \n    \n\n    \n            Ahmed also points to an absence of Muslim representation in the Winter Olympics, which is contrary to the Summer Games.  \n    \n\n    \n            “We see a general trend in … Summer Games – you’ve got Central Asian athletes doing a lot of weightlifting. You’ve got Middle Eastern women doing judo, judokas, or karate, artists and athletes,” Ahmed added. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Frimpong and Nigeria’s Simidele Adeagbo became the first African skeleton racers to compete at PyeongChang 2018 following the introduction of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation’s (IBSF) continental quota system.  \n    \n\n    \n            But the IBSF and the IOC opted to revoke the continental quota for the Beijing Games – something coaches had warned would deliver a “crushing blow” to African athletes hoping to participate in winter sports.  \n    \n\n    \n            Coaches Brian McDonald and Zach Lund warned the IOC in a December 30, 2021 email seen by CNN that “inequitable quotas that didn’t take into account the massive hurdles African athletes must clear in order to train and aspire to be Winter Olympians.  \n    \n\n    \n            “The dream of so many Africans to watch and be inspired by fellow Africans competing in the Winter Olympic Games will bear long-lasting fruit for Olympic sport,” they wrote.  \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “An exclusion will be a crushing blow to African athletes who worked so hard and who dared to dream what once seemed impossible,” they added in the email. \n    \n\n    \n            The quota for sliding sports was removed ahead of Beijing – a decision which directly affected Frimpong. \n    \n\n    \n            “Giving an athlete a quota place, which is not according to the qualification criteria, would consequently imply the exclusion of another athlete qualified in the current qualification system,” an IOC representative told Frimpong’s coaches in a January 12 email seen by CNN. \n    \n\n    \n            “I qualified as Ghana’s first skeleton Olympian, and the first Black male skeleton athlete ever in history at the Olympic Games, both in the world as well as for Africa,” Frimpong told CNN.  \n    \n\n    \n            Frimpong was 99th in world rankings ahead of PyeongChang and qualified through the quota system.  \n    \n\n    \n            “Now, I am 36 points higher than I was, which means I am 63 on the world ranking. I needed to be in the top 60 which is the prerequisite to qualify for this Olympic Games – to be able to qualify outright,” he told CNN. \n    \n\n    \n            On December 29, hoping to compete in three final races and obtain enough points to make the top 60, Frimpong tested positive for Covid-19 and was unable to compete. He did not qualify for the Winter Olympics. \n    \n\n    \n            Frimpong said his pre-Covid rating meant “I could possibly almost qualify outright, meaning that I am as good – maybe not as good as the gold medalist or the top 10 Europeans or whatsoever – but I’m good enough to be in the world class sport that is dominated by Europeans, westerners.”  \n    \n\n    \n            Frimpong said his coaches emailed the IOC asking them to reinstate a continental quota for all winter sports “for qualified African athletes who can safely compete.” \n    \n\n    \n            “We’re not asking them to take away a spot from any other nations, we’re not asking them to give us a free way, or a free card.\n    \n\n    \n            “But if there are African athletes in winter sports that are close to qualifying, which means they are competitive and qualified and can safely compete, that quota should be in place until there’s enough African athletes,” he added. \n    \n\n    \n            In a statement sent to CNN, the IBSF confirmed that the continental quota spot was not included in the Olympic Qualification System for Beijing 2022.  \n    \n\n    \n            “To address Emerging Nations and their needs, the IBSF established a wider Development Program which focused as mentioned on Emerging Nations but equally on gender equity in supporting athletes on their qualification pathway to the Olympic Winter Games Beijing 2022,” the organization said in a statement. \n    \n\n    \n            No athlete representing an African NOC has ever won a medal. \n    \n\n    \n            “We were looking forward to seeing more and more Africans compete in 2022. And now it’s less than half, or at least half of what it was in 2018, so it’s disappointing. The message is clear that inclusiveness is not a priority,” Frimpong added. \n    \n\n    \n            But there is hope – even if only for a select few athletes.\n    \n\n    \n            American bobsledder Meyers Taylor’s bronze in the two-woman bobsled on Saturday gave the 37-year-old her fifth Olympic medal as she surpassed Davis’ four. Meyers Taylor is now the most decorated woman Olympic bobsledder ever.\n    \n\n    \n            When asked about passing Davis’ record saying, she said: “That is overwhelming. It’s so crazy to hear that stat and to know that I’m part of a legacy that’s bigger than me. Hopefully, it just encourages more and more Black athletes to come out to winter sports and not just Black athletes, winter sports for everybody.\n    \n\n    \n            “We want everybody to come out regardless of the color of your skin. We want winter sports to be for everybody, regardless of race, regardless of socio-economic class. I think the more diversity we have, the stronger our sport can be. \n    \n\n    \n            “So, hopefully, this is just the start of more and more people coming out and trying winter sports.”\n

Due to the increase in the volume of the individuals crossing, people have to stay in long queues. However, I can state that everything happens according to the law. There is absolutely no division by nation, citizenship, or class at the border,” Demchenko said.\n    \n\n    \n            Ukraine attracts many foreign students wanting to study medicine because it has a strong reputation for medical courses and tuition – and other expenses are much lower than in programs in other Western nations.\n    \n\n    \n            Another stranded student told CNN on Sunday that border staff on the Ukrainian side of the border were showing prejudice against foreign students.\n    \n\n    \n            “They are depriving the foreigners. They are being very racist with us at the border. They tell us that Ukrainian citizens have to pass first while telling foreigners to stay back,” said Nneka Abigail, a 23-year-old medical student from Nigeria.\n    \n\n    \n            “It’s very difficult at the moment for Nigerians and other foreigners to cross. The Ukrainian officials are allowing more Ukrainians to cross into Poland. For instance, around 200 to 300 Ukrainians can cross, and then only 10 foreigners or 5 will be allowed to cross… and the duration of time is too long. It’s really hard.. they push us, kick us, insult us,” Abigail said.\n    \n\n    \n            Africans have been sharing their experiences online using the hashtag #AfricansinUkraine. Their stories have prompted an outcry and a number of crowdfunding appeals have been launched to try help those stranded in the country.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            One of those who shared their story online is Korrine Sky, a medical student from Zimbabwe who had been studying in Ukraine since September.\n    \n\n    \n            She fled the country on Friday but, with the aid of two London-based friends, managed to raise more than £20,000 ($26,800) to help stranded Afro-Caribbean students.\n    \n\n    \n            “This situation we’re in is a life-or-death situation. We need to make sure that all the African students cross the border successfully and safely,” she said, speaking on Instagram Live from the Romanian side of the border on Sunday.\n    \n\n    \n            Around 500,000 refugees from Ukraine have so far crossed to neighboring European countries, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, said on Monday.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Some of those CNN spoke to said they did not blame the Ukrainian authorities for prioritizing their citizens but rather their own governments for not making arrangements to assist them out of the country.\n    \n\n    \n            The “Nigerian government is being their usual nonchalant self,” Onyegbule said.\n    \n\n    \n            “There are many of us in Ukraine. They can’t just leave us like this. It’s so sad but we are used to the bad governance in Nigeria. It’s very sad.”\n    \n\n    \n            Onyegbule acknowledged that there were Nigerian officials waiting to meet her and others once she crossed over into Poland.\n    \n\n    \n            “It would have been so helpful in Ukraine, we were looking for someone to speak on our behalf there.”\n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria’s foreign affairs minister Geoffrey Onyeama said on Twitter that Ukrainian authorities had assured him that there were no restrictions on foreigners wanting to leave Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            “Problem is the result of chaos on the border and checkpoints leading to them,” he stated, adding that he is “personally coordinating with our missions in Ukraine, Poland, Russia, Romania and Hungary to ensure we get our citizens out of Ukraine and bring back to Nigeria those ready to return while supporting those who are remaining in Ukraine.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            CNN has contacted Onyeama for comment on allegations that the Nigerian government hasn’t done enough to help its citizens leave Ukraine.\n    \n\n    \n            A spokesperson for President Buhari, Garba Shehu, has urged that: “All who flee a conflict situation have the same right to safe passage under UN convention and the colour of their passport or their skin should make no difference.”\n    \n\n    \n            Shehu added that there are some four thousand students in Ukraine from Nigeria mostly studying medicine.\n    \n\n    \n            African nations on the UN Security Council Monday condemned discrimination against African citizens at the Ukrainian border during a UNSC meeting at the UN HQ in New York City.\n    \n\n    \n            “We strongly condemn this racism and believe that it is damaging to the spirit of solidarity that is so urgently needed today. The mistreatment of African peoples on Europe’s borders needs to cease immediately, whether to the Africans fleeing Ukraine or to those crossing the Mediterranean,” Kenyan Ambassador to the UN Martin Kimani said Monday.\n    \n\n    \n            Onyegbule, the first-year medical student, said she was attracted to study in Ukraine because she was looking for a “safe and cheap option outside Nigeria.”\n    \n\n    \n            “Generally living in Ukraine has been peaceful, it’s a beautiful country. Sometimes in the trams, people don’t want to sit beside you and they stare at you but generally, the Ukrainians are nice people,” she said.\n    \n\n  \n  CNN’s Mohamed Tawfeeq reported from Lviv in Ukraine \n\n\n                ', 'length': 10644, 'description': 'As the Russian invasion of Ukraine continues, foreign students attempting to leave the country say they are experiencing racist treatment by Ukrainian security forces and border officials.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220228122757-04-international-students-ukraine-poland.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-01T03:19:56Z', 'keywords': ['africa', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' continents and regions', ' curricula', ' discrimination', ' eastern europe', ' education', ' europe', ' health and medical', ' health care', ' immigration', ' citizenship and displacement', ' international relations', ' international relations and national security', ' medical education', ' nigeria', ' poland', ' racism and racial discrimination', ' refugees', ' societal issues', ' society', ' students and student life', ' territorial and national borders', ' ukraine', ' western africa', ' russia-ukraine conflict', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war', ' government organizations - intl', ' united nations'], 'summary': ['She told CNN: “More than 10 buses came and we were watching everyone leave.', '“There are three checkposts we need to go through to get to the border.', 'Ukrainians are given taxis and buses to travel, all other nationalities have to walk.', 'They were very racist to Indians and other nationalities,’” the 22-year-old from Mumbai told CNN.', 'There is huge pressure on checkpoints, on border guards.', 'They are being very racist with us at the border.', '“There are many of us in Ukraine.', '“Generally living in Ukraine has been peaceful, it’s a beautiful country.', 'CNN’s Mohamed Tawfeeq reported from Lviv in Ukraine'], 'sentiment': {'score': -46, 'comparative': -0.028395061728395062, 'calculation': [{'nice': 3}, {'want': 1}, {'beautiful': 3}, {'peaceful': 2}, {'attracted': 1}, {'solidarity': 2}, {'spirit': 1}, {'damaging': -3}, {'racism': -3}, {'condemn': -2}, {'condemned': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'safe': 1}, {'conflict': -2}, {'leave': -1}, {'help': 2}, {'allegations': -2}, {'supporting': 1}, {'ensure': 1}, {'leading': 2}, {'chaos': -2}, {'leave': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'helpful': 2}, {'sad': -2}, {'bad': -3}, {'sad': -2}, {'like': 2}, {'leave': -1}, {'blame': 2}, {'safely': 1}, {'successfully': 3}, {'help': 2}, {'shared': 1}, {'help': 2}, {'launched': 1}, {'outcry': -2}, {'insult': -2}, {'hard': -1}, {'difficult': -1}, {'racist': -3}, {'strong': 2}, {'attracts': 1}, {'no': -1}, {'increase': 1}, {'allow': 1}, {'pressure': -1}, {'huge': 1}, {'increase': 1}, {'increased': 1}, {'war': -2}, {'leave': -1}, {'attack': -1}, {'pressure': -1}, {'untrue': -2}, {'allegations': -2}, {'help': 2}, {'collapsing': -2}, {'terribly': -3}, {'no': -1}, {'terrified': -3}, {'violence': -3}, {'allegations': -2}, {'beating': -1}, {'care': 2}, {'lost': -3}, {'cruelty': -3}, {'no': -1}, {'beaten': -2}, {'cry': -1}, {'allow': 1}, {'worst': -3}, {'cruel': -3}, {'extend': -1}, {'leave': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'violence': -3}, {'racist': -3}, {'allow': 1}, {'unable': -2}, {'allow': 1}, {'shared': 1}, {'want': 1}, {'no': -1}, {'numb': -1}, {'no': -1}, {'leave': -1}, {'racist': -3}, {'leave': -1}, {'invasion': -1}], 'postive': ['nice', 'want', 'beautiful', 'peaceful', 'attracted', 'solidarity', 'spirit', 'safe', 'help', 'supporting', 'ensure', 'leading', 'helpful', 'like', 'blame', 'safely', 'successfully', 'help', 'shared', 'help', 'launched', 'strong', 'attracts', 'increase', 'allow', 'huge', 'increase', 'increased', 'help', 'care', 'allow', 'allow', 'allow', 'shared', 'want'], 'negative': ['damaging', 'racism', 'condemn', 'condemned', 'no', 'conflict', 'leave', 'allegations', 'chaos', 'leave', 'no', 'sad', 'bad', 'sad', 'leave', 'outcry', 'insult', 'hard', 'difficult', 'racist', 'no', 'pressure', 'war', 'leave', 'attack', 'pressure', 'untrue', 'allegations', 'collapsing', 'terribly', 'no', 'terrified', 'violence', 'allegations', 'beating', 'lost', 'cruelty', 'no', 'beaten', 'cry', 'worst', 'cruel', 'extend', 'leave', 'no', 'violence', 'racist', 'unable', 'no', 'numb', 'no', 'leave', 'racist', 'leave', 'invasion']}}"

Vaccines still do a good job of keeping people alive and out of the hospital. There’s increasing access to tests and treatments. The numbers of cases, hospitalizations and deaths are heading in the right direction.\n    \n\n    \n            If living in a Covid world has taught us anything, however, it’s that the coronavirus can surprise even the smartest public health experts, and the world certainly isn’t out of the woods yet.\n    \n\n    \n            A new variant could easily develop and slip past the protection of current treatments and vaccines, setting us back to what life was like in 2020. That makes it hard to predict what happens next week, let alone in a few months. \n    \n\n    \n            However, based on what they’re seeing now, here’s what the experts think could happen in the next year of the pandemic. Each of these predictions has an unspoken “variant depending” at the end.\n    \n\n  \n    What will spring and summer be like?\n\n\n    \n            The numbers in the US look good. Only 2% of the US population – that’s about 7 million  people – lives in a county with a “high” Covid-19 community level, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rest are at “low” or “medium” community levels, areas where there’s no recommendation to wear a mask or where the immunocompromised should take extra precautions.\n    \n\n    \n            In fact, over the next four weeks, the CDC forecasts decreases in hospitalizations and deaths. The trend could continue, particularly as the weather improves and people head outside, where it’s less likely that they’ll catch Covid.\n    \n\n    \n            These positive trends could mean the US will see a normal or at least near-normal spring and summer (variant depending, of course). \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “I am very optimistic,” said Dr. William Lang, WorldClinic medical director and former White House deputy physician. “I’m optimistic for what things look like for everybody being able to get back to normal activities over the summer.”\n    \n\n    \n            But normal doesn’t mean a return to pre-2020 life. “Fewer” cases still mean tens of thousands of Americans are getting infected. And as of Friday, even with deaths at the lowest level in three months, there are an average of about 1,200 Americans dying from Covid-19 each day, according to Johns Hopkins University. \n    \n\n    \n            “Everyone has to recognize, relatively speaking, we’re still very early in this, right? This is not going away,” said Dr. Abraar Karan, an infectious disease fellow in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Geographic Medicine at Stanford University. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            If the pandemic moves into more of an endemic phase, meaning enough people have immune protection through natural infection and vaccination, it doesn’t mean you can burn your masks. Rather, it means the spread of Covid will slow and result in fewer deaths and hospitalizations. But this state of endemicity is not guaranteed.\n    \n\n    \n            One metric to watch is a rising trend in cases and hospitalizations in the UK. Karan thinks that is mainly happening because of waning immunity, and the US could see similar trends.\n    \n\n    \n            “With the combination of our immunity waning and the virus mutating, future surges are unpredictable,” Karan said.  \n    \n\n  \n    What about autumn and winter?\n\n\n    \n            With the unpredictability of the coronavirus, it’s hard to know what will happen in the fall and winter, said David Montefiori, a virologist at Duke University Medical Center.\n    \n\n    \n            READ: You asked, we’re answering: Your top questions about Covid-19\n    \n\n    \n            “This virus has thrown us some real curveballs,” Montefiori said. Some experts say the coronavirus could eventually become seasonal like flu, but he doesn’t think it’s there yet. \n    \n\n    \n            “Thinking of this as a seasonal virus like flu, that hasn’t been the case so far. The variants seem to be periodic,” Montefiori said. “Roughly every four to six months, we have a new variant.” \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            He is optimistic, though, because Americans have so much immunity built up through vaccination, infection or a combination of the two. \n    \n\n    \n            “We might have another surge later this year, even early summer, but if there isn’t one, that’s saying the immunity we’ve built up as a population is doing a good job.”\n    \n\n    \n            The concern, of course, is that a variant emerges that escapes the vaccines. “The good news is that vaccines can be quickly modified,” Montefiori said.  \n    \n\n    \n            With more access to tests and treatments now, many experts believe that the US is better prepared for a fall or winter surge than it was last year. Some say Covid-19 cases could climb for a while when colder weather sends people back inside and as they become more complacent about taking precautions. \n    \n\n    \n            “Ultimately, the virus is going to have a tough time in our population, but it’s going to take a long time,” said Dr. John Swartzberg, a clinical professor emeritus at UC Berkeley’s School of Public Health. “I think the real long view is, endemicity is going to be the case. Eradication is not possible.”\n    \n\n    \n            Much depends on how quickly the planet can get vaccinated, Swartzberg said. The more people are vaccinated, the fewer there are to serve as hosts where the virus can mutate and produce – you guessed it – variants. \n    \n\n    \n            Less than 10% of people in low-income countries are vaccinated, according to the International Rescue Committee. The US and other countries have pledged to send more vaccines overseas this year.    \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            You may be need a fourth shot of the Covid-19 vaccine this year. The CDC already recommends that those who have weakened immune systems get one. Public health officials in the US have said they are very carefully monitoring if, or when, a fourth dose may be needed for the broader population, with a potential fall timeline in mind.\n    \n\n    \n            The vaccines still seem to protect against hospitalization and death, particularly if you are boosted, but protection could wane over time and is a little less effective against the Omicron variant. The currently authorized boosters are made to protect against the original coronavirus from late 2019.\n    \n\n    \n            The next vaccines could be specifically tuned to the variant – or variants – that are in circulation, Moderna Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Burton said Wednesday. Or they could be a combination shot.\n    \n\n    \n            Moderna and Pfizer have confirmed that they are testing vaccines that focus on Omicron. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said his company will soon submit data on another vaccine dose for federal health officials to consider. \n    \n\n    \n            “I think our data suggests that they’re protecting, they are improving dramatically the protection, the fourth dose compared to the third, for Omicron after some time, after let’s say three to six months,” Bourla said in a Washington Post Live discussion on Thursday. \n    \n\n    \n            Globally, there are 234 other Covid-19 vaccines in development. Perhaps furthest along in the process is the one from Novavax. It is in the middle of the regulatory process with the FDA and could be authorized this year.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Pfizer and Moderna are expected to report results from their trials involving children under the age of 5 in the next few weeks. \n    \n\n    \n            Pfizer is also working on trials of a third vaccine dose for children ages 5 to 11. Children 12 and older can already get a third shot, as can kids 5 and older who are immunocompromised. \n    \n\n    \n            For the littlest kids, scientists think a vaccine may not be authorized until April. Pfizer originally said it thought it could have one out earlier this year, but it added a third dose of the vaccine to its trials to see if it is more effective.  \n    \n\n    \n            The vaccines can’t come soon enough for some parents. During the Omicron surge, the largest increase in hospitalization rates was among kids ages 4 and under, according to the CDC.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            But many more kids for whom vaccines are now authorized still need to get them. They are the age group with the lowest vaccination rate in the US. \n    \n\n    \n            “There still hasn’t been nearly as much uptake as vaccines as we would want,” said Dr. Shira Gertz, a pediatric critical care physician and researcher at Cooperman Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey. “Getting a vaccine is so much better than getting the disease.”\n    \n\n    \n            The politics of it might be tricky, but schools could require that kids get vaccinated against Covid-19 before they return to class in the fall, like they do with other diseases. Only a handful of schools currently do, like those in Los Angeles, the District of Columbia and New Orleans, according to the Center on Reinventing Public Education. \n    \n\n  \n    What’s next for treatments and tests?\n\n\n    \n            There are 23 antivirals and 63 other treatments in late-stage clinical trials, according to Bio, a pharmacy industry association. \n    \n\n    \n            Although Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine is authorized for people as young as 5, treatments for children remain limited. It’s begun a Phase 2 and 3 clinical trial of its Covid-19 antiviral treatment, Paxlovid, in children ages 6 to 17. \n    \n\n    \n            For treatments to work effectively, people have to get them quickly. The Biden administration’s new test-to-treat program allows pharmacies with clinics to test someone for Covid-19 and immediately prescribe medication if they test positive. That program will play an even more vital role if cases surge again. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Hawaii is the last state in the country to end its indoor mask mandate. That ends March 25. \n    \n\n    \n            On Thursday, the federal requirement that people wear masks on public transportation, including planes, was extended for another 30 days.\n    \n\n    \n            People may be sick of them, and masks have become a hot political subject, but broader mask mandates could always come back if case numbers rise and hospitals fill up.\n    \n\n    \n            Masking is hugely effective. Research from January 2021 that analyzed several studies of mask use in adults found that masks reduced the transmission of the virus significantly. And a National Institutes of Health study published Thursday found that during the Delta surge, schools with mandatory masking had 72% fewer cases of in-school transmission than those with mask-optional policies.\n    \n\n    \n            “I think readers need to remember that even if we say ‘this is what we’re doing now,’ we reserve the right to change stuff as needed,” said Dr. Sharon Nachman, chief of the Division of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York. Americans need to be flexible and adjust to the threat around them, she said.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Money to pay for the tests and treatments and vaccine research won’t last forever, and more funding is not in the latest federal spending bill. The $15.6 billion earmarked for pandemic preparedness got stripped out. That was only half of what the Biden administration had asked for.\n    \n\n    \n            The spending bill raises the CDC budget by $582 million, but it leaves out the pandemic waivers that gave schools extra federal funds to cope with Covid-19 outbreaks. \n    \n\n    \n            The money that has bolstered many rural “safety net” hospitals expires soon. Safety net hospitals are those that, by legal obligation or mission, provide health care regardless of someone’s ability to pay or insurance status. So more rural hospitals could close this year, and the US has already lost a record number of them during the pandemic. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            It’s a tenuous time. Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said  supplies of therapeutics, testing and vaccines are finally at a level where they meet demand. \n    \n\n    \n            “If there’s issues with funding and any of those areas of progress start to fall off, we’re going to be right back to the situation where we’re playing catch-up and don’t have enough,” he said.\n    \n\n    \n            On Wednesday, House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, introduced a standalone Covid supplemental bill to manage the pandemic at home and around the world, but it’s unlikely to pass.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Scientists continue to study people with long Covid to try to understand the condition’s symptoms and treatments. As many as 30% who’ve tested positive for the virus may have long-term symptoms like fatigue, breathing trouble, joint and chest pain, and heart problems, studies show. \n    \n\n    \n            Mental health has been an ongoing challenge for adults and kids during the pandemic. Four in 10 adults reported symptoms of anxiety or depression during the pandemic, up from 1 in 10 before the pandemic. In communities of color, mental health issues are disproportionately undertreated. For kids, the Biden administration’s national mental health strategy, announced this month, will try to address some provider and program shortages to address their needs.\n    \n\n    \n            More than 206,800 children in the US have lost their primary caregiver to Covid, and advocates are also pushing for programs to address their needs.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            People need to be flexible and not let down their guard too soon, the experts say. \n    \n\n    \n            “When places relax measures at the wrong moment, transmission spikes dangerously, and we lose more lives,” Pan American Health Organization Director Dr. Carissa F. Etienne said Wednesday, urging countries to base decisions on risk assessments and health data and to tighten public health guidance if cases start to rise.\n    \n\n    \n            The bottom line, Lang said: Covid is here to stay, but the pandemic part could be in our rearview mirror – or at least move into a more manageable stage – if people get vaccinated and boosted. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “The Covid vaccine is much more effective in preventing deaths than the flu vaccine in preventing deaths,” he said. “So, you know, we really can combat this thing by people getting vaccinated and boosted.”\n    \n\n    \n            Gertz also recommends that people pay attention to the numbers around them. \n    \n\n    \n            “We have to continue to be diligent and aware of what’s going on in our immediate surroundings,” she said. That doesn’t mean people will be in masks forever, but they should wear them when necessary, and take prevention measures like washing their hands. “Actually, we should always wash our hands.”\n    \n\n\n                ', 'length': 15240, 'description': 'Things seem to be looking up as the US crosses into year three of the Covid-19 pandemic.

But what if fate not only brings you together, but also places you in direct competition on one of the world’s biggest sporting stages?\n    \n\n    \n            That was the destiny of tennis sensation Cori “Coco” Gauff in 2019 when, as the youngest ever qualifier at Wimbledon, she found herself facing the legendary Venus Williams.\n    \n\n    \n            “I just remember walking out on the court blasting music with my head held down because I didn’t want to look at the crowd,” Gauff told CNN’s Becky Anderson in Dubai. \n    \n\n    \n            “It was such a long walk from the locker room. It was, like, 15 minutes,” she recalls. “Then they have all the walls of the champions, and obviously, I saw Venus there so many times. I was like, ‘Oh my gosh, she’s lifted this trophy so many times. And here I am like, about to go on against her.’”\n    \n\n    \n            What happened next was the stuff of fantasy, as the teenager swept her veteran rival aside in straight sets. Stone-faced, almost disbelieving, Gauff walked slowly towards a beaming Williams, who congratulated her warmly from across the net as the crowd erupted in wild applause.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Almost three years on, Gauff still finds inspiration from Venus and her sister Serena. \n    \n\n    \n            “I’m inspired by both of them,” she says. “And I would say, I don’t know, I just think not only their games, but how they handled themselves off the court is something that I look up to.”\n    \n\n    \n            Gauff also acknowledges the importance of having two Black role models in a sport that has traditionally lacked diversity. “For me, there’s not much representation of people that look like me in this sport; so, for me as a young girl, just seeing them dominate and do it so elegantly, kind of just inspired me.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Venus has also become something of a Coco Gauff fan, too. “I’ve gotten to have conversations with them, like Venus, I got to play doubles with [her]. That was just something I never thought of happening. And she’s always rooting for me. \n    \n\n    \n            “I remember her posting Instagram stories saying, people ask her questions like, ‘Who she’s rooting for?’ and she would say, ‘Serena,’ and then she will say, also me, and I thought that’s just really cool because I never thought that would happen. \n    \n\n    \n            “I mean, as a kid, I never thought I’d play either of them, let alone play doubles with one of them!”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Although she will only turn 18 in March, Gauff is already treading her own path as a role model for others. She spoke out during the protests following the murder of George Floyd and believes in using her position to inspire change.  \n    \n\n    \n            “For me, I just feel like it’s not so much of responsibility, I feel like that’s just me, and that’s like my identity,” she told Anderson.\n    \n\n    \n            “I want to stand up for people who look like me and feel like they don’t have a voice. And I’m lucky enough that some people in the world care about what I have to say. So I try to make sure that I say it and say in a correct way, or in a way that people understand.”  \n    \n\n    \n            She says she is mindful of setting an example to her two younger brothers. “I would say I just kind of try to hold myself to what I want my brothers to be, [and be] a role model for my brothers.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The Atlanta-born star also draws her own inspiration from closer to home. Her grandmother survived cancer, and Gauff says watching that battle, and the positive mindset with which her grandmother approached it, was a learning experience. \n    \n\n    \n            “I think your mind kind of controls everything. Your mind controls, you know, how your body feels and how your mood is,” she explains.  \n    \n\n    \n            “One of the things I learned growing up, my grandmother she had lung cancer when I was younger, and now she’s cancer free, but I just remember her never being too negative about it, and her always being positive.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            That attitude made a lasting impression on the youngster and her views on mental health. “I remembered my grandmother telling me that the only reason she thinks she conquered it – because she had stage four and the chances weren’t looking good – was that she would just wake up every day so mentally in a positive and happy light. \n    \n\n    \n            “You know, as a kid, I didn’t really understand what was going on. But I remember just never seeing her sad or upset or saying, ‘Why me?’ Instead, she was saying, like, ‘Why not me?’ So I think for me, now at this age, that showed me that your mindset can change everything in your life. So, if you’re not good mentally, you know, it could be as painful.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            A new pressure that young sports stars are born into now is the spotlight of social media, and Gauff says that she has learned to avoid spending too much time online. \n    \n\n    \n            “I’m really rarely on Twitter or Instagram. I’m just there to like my friends’ posts and comment and then log off again,” she says. “I would say TikTok is the only one that I’m on the most, just because I don’t see much tennis, I don’t see much about me on the app, which I like.”\n    \n\n    \n            Resisting the temptation to try and please everyone on social media is important, Gauff believes. “I feel like a lot of people have a lot of nice things to say, I would say definitely the positive outweighs the bad. But I guess, you know, I feel like as a human you kind of want to look at what people are saying to you and saying about you. \n    \n\n    \n            “As humans, we have it in our heads to please everyone, so you want to know what bad things people think about you so you can fix it. But some things are just, you just can’t fix it. And so I just kind of stay off it.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            It is a single-minded philosophy that seems to extend to other areas of her life, too. Gauff is a firm believer in following your own path for your own reasons. \n    \n\n    \n            “If you’re not doing it for yourself, then don’t waste your time doing it,” she says. “Because you have to remember this is going to be your life and you don’t want to spend the only life that you have being miserable.”\n    \n\n    \n            Making every moment count is a part of that, she says. “I think every day counts, whether it’s something little that you do every day, it’s a chance to improve.

first world title last year, Max Verstappen has signed a long-term contract extension with Red Bull Racing which will keep him with the team until 2028.\n    \n\n    \n            The Dutchman’s current contract was due to expire after the 2023 season but the 24-year-old is eying more long-term success with the team.\n    \n\n    \n            “I really enjoy being part of the Oracle Red Bull Racing Team, so choosing to stay to the 2028 season was an easy decision,” Verstappen said in a statement, speaking of his new five-year deal.\n    \n\n    \n            “I love this Team and last year was simply incredible, our goal since we came together in 2016 was to win the championship and we have done that, so now it’s about keeping the number one on the car long-term.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            In the immediate aftermath of the dramatic title-deciding race in Abu Dhabi last year, Verstappen signaled his intentions for a long relationship with Red Bull.\n    \n\n    \n            “My team know I love them and I want to do this with them for the next 10 or 15 years,” he said at the time. \n    \n\n    \n            That wish now looks to be a reality with Red Bull Racing’s

Hospitalizations were up 17% over the same period. \n    \n\n    \n            The country’s daily case rate – about 55,000 a day – is still less than a third of the Omicron peak, but cases are rising as fast as they were falling just two weeks earlier, when the country removed pandemic-related restrictions.  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Daily cases are also rising in more than half of the countries in the European Union. They’ve jumped 48% in the Netherlands and 20% in Germany over the past week, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. But daily cases in Germany had yet to drop below pre-Omicron levels, and the Netherlands hadn’t seen cases fall as much as they did in the UK.  \n    \n\n    \n            The situation in Europe has the attention of public health officials for two reasons: First, the UK offers a preview of what may play out in the United States, and second, something unusual seems to be happening. In previous waves, increases in Covid hospitalizations lagged behind jumps in cases by about 10 days to two weeks. Now, in the UK, cases and hospitalizations seem to be rising in tandem, something that has experts stumped.\n    \n\n    \n            “So we’re obviously keenly interested in what’s going on with that,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN.  \n    \n\n    \n            Fauci said he’s spoken with his UK counterparts, and they have pegged the rise to a combination three factors. In order of contribution, Fauci said, these are:\n    \n\n  \n  \n      The BA.2 variant, which is more transmissible than the original Omicron \n      The opening of society, with people mingling more indoors without masks\n      Waning immunity from vaccination or prior infection\n  \n\n\n    \n            In a technical briefing Friday, the UK Health Security Agency said BA.2 had an 80% higher relative growth rate than the original Omicron strain, though it does not seem more likely to lead to hospitalization.  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Given that BA.2 doesn’t seem to be causing more severe disease – at least not in the highly vaccinated British population – it’s not clear why hospitalizations are ticking up.\n    \n\n    \n            “The issue with hospitalization is a little bit more puzzling, because although the hospitalizations are going up, it is very clear their use of ICU beds has not increased,” Fauci said. “So are the numbers of hospitalizations a real reflection of Covid cases, or is there a difficulty deciphering between people coming into the hospital with Covid or because of Covid?” \n    \n\n    \n            The US, like the UK, has lifted most mitigation measures as Covid-19 infections have fallen. Two weeks ago, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed how it measures Covid-19 impact in communities. The new metric – which relies on hospitalizations and hospital capacity in addition to cases – did away with masking recommendations for most parts of the country. States and schools have followed suit, lifting indoor masking requirements.\n    \n\n    \n            READ: Your top Covid questions, answered\n    \n\n    \n            “Without a doubt, opening up society and having people mingle indoors is clearly something that is a contributor, as well as overall waning immunity, which means we’ve really got to stay heads-up and keep our eye on the pattern here,” Fauci said. “So that’s the reason why we’re watching this very carefully.”\n    \n\n    \n            Michael Osterholm, who directs the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, told CNN, “it’s like a weather alert.

Aged 8 to 18, they are focused on the chess boards before them, calculating moves that will allow them to win the game.\n    \n\n    \n            Chess master Tunde Onakoya is supervising the tournament. Each week, he and the rest of the team at Chess in Slums Africa teach children in low-income communities to play chess.\n    \n\n    \n            Founded by Onakoya in 2018, he says the non-profit is focused on kids in poor communities, who are least likely to have access to education. He hopes that playing chess will open up opportunities for them beyond their lives in the slum. \n    \n\n    \n            The 26-year-old’s posts about the living conditions and talents of the kids often go viral on social media, gaining the attention of donors, well-wishers, and recently, the governor of Lagos state. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “I realized that every time I shared the stories of one of our kids on Facebook or Twitter, people were willing to donate money to fund their education,” Onakoya says. “So, through that medium about 12 children got scholarships.”\n    \n\n    \n            Chess in Slums Africa has also partnered with tech-focused organizations like Venture Garden Foundations, allowing them to secure even more scholarships home and abroad for some of their best chess players. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Onakoya and his team aren’t the only ones that have been making chess moves on the continent.\n    \n\n    \n            There are 46 countries in Africa with strong chess communities, according to the African Chess Federation. Since 2014, the continent has produced six new grandmasters – the highest possible title in the game – in Algeria, South Africa, and Egypt. \n    \n\n    \n            In Uganda, Phiona Mutesi discovered the gift of chess at the age of 9 after enrolling in a chess club in her slum neighborhood of Katwe back in 2005. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            She eventually became Uganda’s national champion, representing the East African country at international tournaments. Mutesi, the subject of a 2012 book and a 2016 Disney film called “Queen of Katwe,” told CNN in a 2012 interview that “chess gave me hope.” \n    \n\n    \n            That hopeful spirit is what chess coach James Kangaru wants to inspire in communities and schools in Kenya. \n    \n\n    \n            Kangaru, 28, started playing chess in high school and became a coach after university. In 2015, he founded a community outreach program called Epitome School of Chess to teach young children how to play the game. \n    \n\n    \n            “I started my programs in Ruai, an outskirt of Nairobi and also in Mavoko. When those two programs started it was all about having a new sport for the kids … I believed a board game would work best for them,” Kangaru says. \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    African chess players are making moves for their communities\n                \n                    \n                                23:00\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n    \n            One of his top students, two-time national champion Joy Njeri, 12, says traveling for tournaments has given her more exposure. “It is fun visiting new places,” she says, because “you get to meet a lot of amazing people and learn from them as they teach you better moves and show you more about chess.”\n    \n\n    \n            In 2018, Kangaru was recognized as one of the best chess coaches by the International Chess Federation, the game’s global governing body – becoming Africa’s youngest FIDE instructor, he says, which is one of the top coaching levels recognized by the world federation.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Kangaru says countries like China, the US, and India are making an impact through the game by producing world champions.

The higher prices make wheat more expensive for food makers, who will likely pass those costs on to consumers. \n    \n\n    \n            Ukraine and Russia together are responsible for about 14% of global wheat production, according to Gro Intelligence, an agricultural data analytics firm. The two countries supply about 29% of all wheat exports. Prior to the Russian invasion, Ukraine was on track for a record year of wheat exports, while Russia’s wheat exports were slowing, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n    \n\n    \n            “This could not come have come in the worse time,” said Robb MacKie, president and CEO of American Bakers Association. \n    \n\n    \n            With wheat prices already on the rise, the conflict abroad is placing even more pressure on a still ailing supply chain. Russia is the top exporter or wheat, while Ukraine is in the top 5. The two counties compete in export markets like Egypt, Turkey, and Bangladesh.\n    \n\n    \n            “Depending on how this comes out and how long it goes, wheat farmers [in Ukraine] may not be able to plant spring wheat, corn and other things. So, they might go a year without any crops,” MacKie added.\n    \n\n    \n            That will likely push prices on US consumer items like cereal and bread higher. Cereal and baked goods were up 6.8% in the last year because of inflation, according to the US Labor Department. Consumer prices usually lag market prices of wheat, corn, grain – as these commodity prices are contracted in advance. That means the impact may not be felt for weeks or months.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Russia’s actions also have caused a major disruption to Ukrainian ports, hobbling the export market. \n    \n\n    \n            “You’ve got all kinds of logistical restrictions,” said Jim Heneghan, SVP of Agribusiness at Gro Intelligence. For example, “Ukrainian ports [are] closed to commercial traffic,” Heneghan said. And there also are reports of commercial ships being attacked. \n    \n\n    \n            The disruptions are tightening global wheat supplies, even as demand stays the same or spikes. And with less supply, prices are rising even more than they have during the pandemic.  \n    \n\n    \n            Global food prices rose as much as 28% in 2021, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Supply chain disruptions and extreme weather contributed to the higher prices. \n    \n\n    \n            The current situation “is just adding to additional food price inflation that we’ve been witnessing,” Heneghan said. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Most US consumer brands don’t rely on imported ingredients, said Katie Denis, who leads communications and research for the Consumer Brands Association, a US trade group. \n    \n\n    \n            “For the US market, we only import about 8% of the total stuff needed for the [consumer packaged goods] industry,” she said. “It’s pretty minimal.” Most imported items come from Mexico and Canada, she added. \n    \n\n    \n            Higher wheat prices are good news for US farmers, as more demand could shift to the US. Even so, although US companies may not have direct exposure to disruptions in Ukraine, they aren’t immune from them, either. “This is a global economy,” Denis said. “The pricing pressure will be something felt across the entire world.” \n    \n\n    \n            Gro Intellligence’s Heneghan said that as global supply tightens, US wheat farmers could export more product. “A lot of times, you’ll see the demand come back to the US … when you have global events that shut down exportable surpluses,” he said. “But it comes at a higher price.” \n    \n\n    \n            That could be good news for US farmers, he added, but not for consumers.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            “Over the next few months, you’ll see what food companies … will have to do with the higher prices they’re having to contend with,” Heneghan said.

Its most recent foreign currency default came in 1918 when Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin repudiated bonds issued by the Tsarist government.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            The Russian government has borrowed relatively little. JPMorgan estimates that it had about $40 billion of foreign currency debt at the end of last year, with about half of that held by foreign investors.\n    \n\n    \n            But the potential consequences of a default are difficult to gauge. The 2008 global financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic showed how negative shocks can spread across the modern interconnected global financial system and economy. \n    \n\n    \n            International banks are owed more than $121 billion by Russian entities, according to the Bank for International Settlements. European banks have over $84 billion total claims, with France, Italy and Austria the most exposed, and US banks owed $14.7 billion.\n    \n\n    \n            Georgieva said Sunday that a financial crisis was unlikely to develop “for now,” saying that the exposure of Western banks was “not systemically relevant.”\n    \n\n    \n            Even if Moscow halts payments to foreign investors on all sovereign debt, the roughly $60 billion default — including ruble debt held overseas — would be in the same ballpark as Argentina’s in 2020 — a non-event for markets.\n    \n\n    \n            But analysts at Capital Economics warned that one major financial institution might be particularly exposed to Russian debt, which could cause broader financial contagion. A second risk is that a default could trigger missed payments by Russian companies.\n    \n\n    \n            Vladimir Potanin, Russia’s richest businessman, called last week for Moscow to ease restrictions on foreign currency so that interest could be paid on foreign bonds and loans. Otherwise, there was a risk the country could default on its entire external debt, which he estimated at about $480 billion.\n    \n\n    \n            “For Russia, the main cost is being locked out of global capital markets, or at least higher borrowing costs for a prolonged period. But sanctions have done that anyway,” wrote analysts at Capital Economics.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 4702, 'description': 'Russia has sent the clearest signal yet that it will soon default — the first time it will have failed to meet its foreign debt obligations since the Bolshevik revolution more than a century ago.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220314081544-vladimir-putin-0302.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-14T16:01:30Z', 'keywords': ['continents and regions', ' eastern europe', ' embassies and consulates', ' europe', ' government and public administration', ' government bodies and offices', ' government departments and authorities', ' international relations', ' international relations and national security', ' russia', ' state departments and diplomatic services', ' embargoes and sanctions', ' political figures - intl', ' russia-ukraine conflict', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war', ' vladimir putin', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' currencies', ' economy and economic indicators', ' money', ' banknotes and coins', ' moscow', ' banking', ' finance and investments', ' consumer loans and credit', ' personal finance'], 'summary': ['Although Russia has issued bonds that can be repaid in multiple currencies since 2018, these payments must be made in US dollars.', '“Russia has the money to service its debt, but cannot access it,” she said during an interview on CBS’ Face the Nation.', 'The interest payments due Wednesday come with a 30-day grace period.', 'But credit ratings agencies could declare Russia to be in default before that period ends if Moscow makes clear that it does not intend to pay.', 'But the potential consequences of a default are difficult to gauge.', 'A second risk is that a default could trigger missed payments by Russian companies.', 'Otherwise, there was a risk the country could default on its entire external debt, which he estimated at about $480 billion.'], 'sentiment': {'score': -47, 'comparative': -0.06871345029239766, 'calculation': [{'debt': -2}, {'risk': -2}, {'interest': 1}, {'ease': 2}, {'missed': -2}, {'risk': -2}, {'contagion': -2}, {'debt': -2}, {'exposed': -1}, {'warned': -2}, {'debt': -2}, {'debt': -2}, {'unlikely': -1}, {'crisis': -3}, {'exposed': -1}, {'settlements': 1}, {'shocks': -2}, {'negative': -2}, {'crisis': -3}, {'difficult': -1}, {'debt': -2}, {'collapse': -2}, {'crisis': -3}, {'debt': -2}, {'pay': -1}, {'clear': 1}, {'grace': 1}, {'interest': 1}, {'warned': -2}, {'undermined': -2}, {'ability': 2}, {'willingness': 2}, {'debt': -2}, {'debt': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'interest': 1}, {'debt': -2}, {'invasion': -1}, {'imposed': -1}, {'debt': -2}, {'failed': -2}], 'postive': ['interest', 'ease', 'settlements', 'clear', 'grace', 'interest', 'ability', 'willingness', 'interest'], 'negative': ['debt', 'risk', 'missed', 'risk', 'contagion', 'debt', 'exposed', 'warned', 'debt', 'debt', 'unlikely', 'crisis', 'exposed', 'shocks', 'negative', 'crisis', 'difficult', 'debt', 'collapse', 'crisis', 'debt', 'pay', 'warned', 'undermined', 'debt', 'debt', 'no', 'debt', 'invasion', 'imposed', 'debt', 'failed']}}"

With al-Siyabi’s help, her training schedule developed into that of a fully-fledged endurance athlete, consisting of running, hiking, rock climbing, canyoning and caving. \n    \n\n    \n            The physical preparation for Everest was challenging, but improving her mental stamina was even harder. “Training the mind […] it’s harder than training our bodies,” she says. \n    \n\n    \n            In the two years leading up to the climb, the only other person who knew about Alharthy’s ambition was al-Siyabi. “We kept it as a secret for a long time,” she says.\n    \n\n    \n            She wasn’t just building up her mental strength for Everest, but also working up the courage to tell her family: “I was scared to tell them because I just decided to go to Everest without any experience.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            In 2019, two months before setting off for Nepal, Alharthy told her family about the expedition. \n    \n\n    \n            “They were very surprised and shocked because I never discussed it before. They refused the idea from the beginning. My mom was very stressed and worried about my safety,” she says.\n    \n\n    \n            Despite their reaction, she was determined to fulfil her ambition. She arrived in Kathmandu flanked by an all-Arab, all-female team – including Mona Shahab from Saudi Arabia, and Joyce Azzam and Nelly Attar from Lebanon.\n    \n\n    \n            She was in constant contact with al-Siyabi until her arrival at base camp, when their line of communication started to dwindle. Her mentor had recently been admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke. \n    \n\n    \n            “I started feeling worried about him. But I said, ‘OK, he will make it, he’s strong,’” she says.\n    \n\n    \n            A week later Alharthy received the devastating news that al-Siyabi had passed away at the age of 46. She was in shock: “Losing him, it was the hardest time there when I was climbing.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            His death gave the expedition a new sense of purpose. Alharthy wasn’t just climbing to fulfill her own ambition, she wanted to honor al-Siyabi’s memory as well.  \n    \n\n    \n            “He was the only person who stood with me, he helped me,” she says. \n    \n\n    \n            “I decided to do it not for myself and not only my country, he would also be part of […] the climb.”\n    \n\n    \n            After two months of trekking across snow capped mountains, she found herself atop Everest on May 23, exactly nine years to the day since al-Siyabi’s summit. She commemorated her mentor by planting a piece of paper inscribed with his name on the crest of the mountain. \n    \n\n    \n            The poetry of their story isn’t lost on her, acknowledging that “the first Omani man helped me to be the first Omani woman [to summit Everest].” \n    \n\n    \n            She says completing her first summit alongside three other Arab women was what crowned her triumph: “I was very lucky to have them […] it brought us all together.”\n    \n\n    \n            Two years later, Alharthy’s face still lights up when she revisits her memories of climbing Everest. “It’s not like when you buy something, when you try a new meal, when you go shopping,” she says. “It was a different type of happiness.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            While participating in endurance sports, Alharthy has had the chance to connect with fellow mountaineers. \n    \n\n    \n            In January, she became the first Arab woman to summit Ama Dablam (22,349 feet) – a mountain south of Everest – while climbing alongside Qatari mountaineer Fahad Badar. \n    \n\n    \n            “I was not planning to go to Ama Dablam from the beginning. Then one of our friends, Fahad […] he messaged me that he was going,” says Alharthy.\n    \n\n    \n            “I told him, I’m not as afraid of climbing the mountain as I was afraid of the cold because it’s winter season and that’s very difficult.” \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Having unsuccessfully attempted the same climb in 2018, Alharthy was “scared of failing again,” but she knew that Badar’s moral support, coupled with her training for Everest, would set her in good stead. “I felt that I was prepared.”\n    \n\n    \n            With an exposed ridge that requires vertical mixed climbing in rock, ice and snow, she acknowledges this was her most grueling trial yet. \n    \n\n    \n            She says the technical know-how and full-body strength required to climb Ama Dablam surpassed Everest. \n    \n\n    \n            “There is no way for mistakes on Ama Dablam because it’s like you are climbing a big wall. We had to be attached on safety ropes all the time,” she adds. “If we miss anything, it’s very dangerous.” \n    \n\n    \n            Over the past year, Alharthy hasn’t had a chance to plan ahead for expeditions due to coronavirus-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, she’s been taking advantage of Oman’s arid desert terrain – most recently visiting the country’s epic Al Hoota Cave, which is over two million years old and has a total length of almost 2.8 miles. \n    \n\n    \n            “I want to use all the chances I have here in Oman to improve myself physically,” she says.\n    \n\n    \n            Her next goal is to climb one of the 14 mountain peaks across the world that stand taller than 8,000m, dubbed by NASA as the Eight Thousanders. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Cementing her status as a record-breaking mountaineer means that Alharthy has attracted waves of media attention over the past few years, but she was never searching for the spotlight. \n    \n\n    \n            Even though she relishes the opportunity to develop her physicality and test her resilience, she says that the intense media scrutiny that comes with the job is emotionally draining. \n    \n\n    \n            Her limits were tested after Everest. She was having trouble dealing with the emotional comedown of completing such a monumental feat and decided to stop training for a while. “I was feeling depressed,” she says. “I felt this pressure on me, it was something I was not looking for.” \n    \n\n    \n            Alharthy has since found solidarity through her faith. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Ahead of her expedition to Ama Dablam, she earned messages of support from her Muslim fans on social media, where she has now amassed over 16,000 followers. She sees their prayers as a form of protection. “Our faith […] it makes you stand up again. It gives you strength, it gives you power.”\n    \n\n    \n            Her increased visibility online means that her family is now more accepting of her endeavors. But like any parent, her mother continues to agonize over the safety of her daughter. “For them, it’s something very exposed, it’s something very unsafe. My mom, she’s waiting for me to tell her that I will never climb again,” she says. “They support me to do what I want, but they are worried.”\n    \n\n    \n            She continues to inspire confidence in other Muslim women, many of whom have been encouraged to participate in outdoor sports after reading about her story. \n    \n\n    \n            “When I started training, many women were reluctant to do outdoor sports, especially those who wear the hijab, but it’s now becoming quite common,” she recently told the Times. \n    \n\n    \n            Her 32 nieces also embolden her to share her journey and highlight the power of female participation in sport. “They are very strong, and they stand up for their rights,” she says.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Alharthy says the main purpose of her journey is to practice author Todd Henry’s mantra – to figuratively “die empty” from sharing knowledge: “I think that’s what Khalid was doing with many Omanis.” \n    \n\n    \n            “I think it’s a great story,” she goes on to tell CNN. “Even for the new generation, for the other girls and men, just to support each other, to help each other, not to hold knowledge for ourselves.” \n    \n\n    \n            She hopes that by teaching others about her experience through her newly appointed role as the general manager’s assistant for the Girl Guides of Oman, she can lift up a new generation of young Omani people to take up endurance sports.\n    \n\n    \n            Alharthy is also learning from her peers. She references one of her Everest teammates, Arthur Muir, who was initially unable to finish his trek in 2019. However, in May of this year, he became the oldest American to climb the world’s highest peak at age 75. \n    \n\n    \n            “He’s very positive, [a] great personality, [an] inspiration for all of us,” she says. “Believe in yourself, believe in your dream and work hard.”\n    \n\n    \n            Ultimately, she draws strength from staying committed to her faith and her Omani roots. \n    \n\n    \n            “I always wake up in the morning and say, ‘Alhumdullilah, thank God I’m here […] I reached my goal,” she says. \n    \n\n                ', 'length': 10006, 'description': 'It was a chance encounter that would change her life forever.

Onuzo says Inkblot has seven films in various stages from production, while Akinmolayan names crime drama “The Man for the Job,” a romantic comedy, and an “X-Men”-style superhero movie among Anthill’s future titles.\n    \n\n    \n            “We are very excited, because we feel that there’s a significant opportunity for Nigerian and African filmmakers to fully engage with the world over the next three to five years,” says Onuzo. “It’s a good time to be an African content creator.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 6221, 'description': 'Amazon Prime Video has secured deals with Nigerian studios Inkblot Productions and Anthill Studios, which could shake up the local film industry.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220302172320-inkblot-productions-nigeria-founders.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-09T09:01:37Z', 'keywords': ['africa', ' amazon.com inc', ' arts and entertainment', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' companies', ' continents and regions', ' media industry', ' movie and video industry', ' movies', ' nigeria', ' nollywood', ' western africa'], 'summary': ['Its films will also appear on Prime Video after a theatrical window, in a multi-year agreement.', '“We jumped at the deal,” says founder and creative director Niyi Akinmolayan.', 'The Anthill deal followed a month later.', 'Anthill’s Akinmolayan, also a film director, says Amazon has been hands off so far.', '“They’re not telling you the kind of films to make,” he says.', 'The next stage of Prime Video’s move into the African market is already underway.', 'For Anthill and Inkblot, their immediate focus is on their upcoming slates.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 48, 'comparative': 0.05274725274725275, 'calculation': [{'good': 3}, {'engage': 1}, {'opportunity': 2}, {'significant': 1}, {'excited': 3}, {'comedy': 1}, {'crime': -3}, {'meaningful': 2}, {'talent': 2}, {'jokes': 2}, {'pray': 1}, {'marvel': 3}, {'no': -1}, {'matter': 1}, {'no': -1}, {'huge': 1}, {'forgiving': 1}, {'share': 1}, {'encourage': 2}, {'kill': -3}, {'determined': 2}, {'pay': -1}, {'share': -1}, {'appealing': 2}, {'engage': 1}, {'rich': 2}, {'accessible': 1}, {'appealing': 2}, {'kind': 2}, {'struck': -1}, {'kind': 2}, {'growth': 2}, {'want': 1}, {'kind': 2}, {'ambitious': 2}, {'creative': 2}, {'agreement': 1}, {'opportunity': 2}, {'opportunity': 2}, {'exclusive': 2}, {'secured': 2}], 'postive': ['good', 'engage', 'opportunity', 'significant', 'excited', 'comedy', 'meaningful', 'talent', 'jokes', 'pray', 'marvel', 'matter', 'huge', 'forgiving', 'share', 'encourage', 'determined', 'appealing', 'engage', 'rich', 'accessible', 'appealing', 'kind', 'kind', 'growth', 'want', 'kind', 'ambitious', 'creative', 'agreement', 'opportunity', 'opportunity', 'exclusive', 'secured'], 'negative': ['crime', 'no', 'no', 'kill', 'pay', 'share', 'struck']}}"

Co-author Malone Mukwende, a medical student in London, wrote over email that “Chidiebere’s work … unearths some of the biases that exist in medicine in plain sight that we may not be aware of. Representation in healthcare is imperative to ensure that we do not allow implicit biases to cultivate in our heads.”\n    \n\n    \n            Ibe, who earned a chemistry degree in Nigeria and is now studying medicine in Ukraine, only began his medical illustrations in 2020. He has already created images depicting anatomy and a range of conditions, such as the skin disorder vitiligo, cold sores, a chest infection and spinal injuries, all in Black people. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Ibe says that a lack of illustrations of skin conditions in Black skin makes it hard for medical students to diagnose them. Mukwende hopes that together they can create “the blueprint for the world” in terms of what diverse medical textbooks should look like and that “Mind the Gap” will be known as “the go-to textbook for representation of a variety of skin tones.” \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Dr. Jenna Lester, an assistant professor in the department of Dermatology at the University of California, San Francisco, describes Ibe’s illustrations as “incredible.”\n    \n\n    \n            Lester is director of the university’s Skin of Color program, which provides a space for Black, Asian, Latinx and indigenous people to understand conditions that affect them and become more comfortable seeking care.

But it’s coming under huge pressure from developed countries to abandon fossil fuels and shift to renewable energy in order to help save the climate.\n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria is not the only country confronting this dilemma. At the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow, developing economies across Africa, Asia and Latin America are facing increasing pressure to cut carbon emissions at the very moment they are industrializing, a process that powered the advance of the West and lifted billions of people out of poverty.\n    \n\n    \n            At the same time, many poor countries that have so far contributed very little to global CO2 emissions are particularly vulnerable to rising temperatures and increased droughts, fires and floods linked to climate change, which threaten food security and exacerbate water scarcity. \n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria’s largest city Lagos, for example, may become uninhabitable by the end of this century if sea levels continue rising, according to scientific projections. It is already grappling with an eroding coastline that makes the city vulnerable to flooding. \n    \n\n    \n            Yet the average person in Nigeria emits less than 0.7 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to the World Bank. That compares with the European Union’s 6.4 metric tons per capita and North America’s 15.3 metric tons.  \n    \n\n    \n            “The biggest justice issue is that the countries that are the least developed are also the most vulnerable and have the least ability to adapt to climate impacts,” said Amal-Lee Amin, climate change director at CDC Group, Britain’s development finance institution.\n    \n\n    \n            If poor countries are asked to give up fossil fuel production, experts say their wealthy counterparts need to spend trillions of dollars to develop solutions that both spur economic development and protect the planet. If that doesn’t happen, the global poor may be left behind in the energy transition.\n    \n\n    \n            Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2060 on Tuesday, joining other large energy exporters including Saudi Arabia. But he also told COP26 attendees that Nigeria needs “adequate and sustained technical and financial support” to meet its goal.\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            Millions of Nigerians don’t have access to electricity. But the country’s government and economy depend on energy.\n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria is Africa’s biggest oil producer, with fossil fuels accounting for 60% of government revenue and 90% of foreign exchange earnings. The Petroleum Industry Act, which Buhari signed into law in August, envisions an even greater role for oil and gas in Nigeria’s economy.\n    \n\n    \n            “The intent [of the Act] is to really transform the industry for us to be able to attract the required investment into oil and gas,” explained Adewale Ajayi, a partner at KPMG in Lagos. That entails ramping up oil production to 4 million barrels per day, from 1.6 million barrels currently, and drawing on the country’s roughly 200 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves to provide much needed electricity. \n    \n\n    \n            “We have enormous reserves of gas in Nigeria and we need to be able to tap into those resources to develop the Nigerian economy,” Ajayi told CNN Business, adding that alongside power generation, gas will also be crucial to developing industries such as petrochemicals and fertilizers.\n    \n\n    \n            The law also lays the groundwork for developing oil refining capacity, which would allow Nigeria to stop importing virtually all of its fuel at an enormous cost.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Change can’t come quickly enough in a country where some 90 million people, or more than 40% of the population, don’t have access to electricity and more than 80 million live on less than $1 a day. \n    \n\n    \n            “Nigeria will soon, certainly before 2050, have a larger population than the United States, but it has less than 1% of America’s electricity generation capacity,” said Todd Moss, executive director of the Energy for Growth Hub, a nonprofit focused on energy for development based in Washington D.C. \n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria’s installed power generation capacity is about 13 gigawatts, but only about 4 or 5 gigawatts reaches end users due to breakdowns in transmission and distribution. By comparison, the United States has over 1,000 gigawatts of utliity-scale electricity generating capacity.\n    \n\n    \n            “Nigeria just needs a lot more energy,” added Moss. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Nigeria’s energy ambitions are coming up against a global drive by banks, pension funds and development finance institutions to limit or altogether halt investments into fossil fuels in line with net-zero emissions goals.\n    \n\n    \n            “They’re prioritizing global emissions over Africa’s development needs,” said Moss. \n    \n\n    \n            Across Sub-Saharan Africa, natural gas projects are “increasingly imperiled by a lack of development finance,” according to Nigeria’s Vice President Yemi Osinbajo.\n    \n\n    \n            “Efforts to restrict fossil fuel investments in Africa are even harder to stomach because many of the wealthy countries behind them — including Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States — include natural gas in their own multidecade plans to transition to clean energy,” Osinbajo wrote recently in Foreign Affairs.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            The European Investment Bank will end financing for fossil fuel energy projects from the end of this year, with some exceptions for gas-fired power plants, while the World Bank, the biggest provider of climate finance to developing countries, is moving towards restricting its fossil fuel investments, according to Reuters.\n    \n\n    \n            CDC Group will no longer invest in most parts of the coal, oil and gas industries, according to its recent fossil fuel policy. CDC will consider investments into gas power where there are “large unmet energy needs” and if these are consistent with a pathway to net zero, according to Amin.\n    \n\n    \n            Moves by such institutions to restrict fossil fuel funding come despite the fact that the United Kingdom relies on gas for around two thirds of its electricity, while the European Union currently has €87 billion ($102 billion) worth of gas projects in the pipeline, according to a report by the Global Energy Monitor. \n    \n\n    \n            In the United States, natural gas makes up 40% of utility-scale electricity generation, with coal, nuclear and renewables contributing about 20% each, according to the US Energy Information Administration.\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Like the United States, Europe and Britain, Nigeria sees a prominent role for renewable energy, notwithstanding its investments into gas power. \n    \n\n    \n            The government is targeting 32 gigawatts of on-grid power generation capacity by 2030, with renewables expected to contribute 43% and gas making up 41%. When off-grid capacity is included, gas and renewables will contribute roughly 30% each to planned power generation capacity of 45 gigawatts. \n    \n\n    \n            “In Nigeria, clean energy is central to our government’s plan to transition to net-zero emissions,” Osinbajo, the vice president, continued. “But our citizens cannot be forced to wait for battery prices to fall or new technologies to be created in order to have reliable energy and live modern, dignified lives.”\n    \n\n    \n            Sub-Saharan Africa is home to three quarters of the 760 million people globally without access to electricity, according to the World Bank, which expects that number to rise as a result of the pandemic. Less than half of the population has access to electricity in their homes.\n    \n\n    \n            In Nigeria, energy poverty is itself a major driver of emissions, according to Olu Verheijen, the founder of Lagos-based energy advisory business Latimer Energy. Given how scarce and unreliable existing supply is, many households and businesses rely on diesel generators for backup energy supply, while the lack of access to modern cooking technologies is a major driver of deforestation.\n    \n\n    \n            “If you’re siting on massive reserves of gas that have already been commercialized, it makes sense to extend that existing infrastructure to satisfy energy needs, diversify the economy and lift citizens out of poverty,” Verheijen said.\n    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The Nigerian government’s Solar Power Naija initiative — which aims to deploy 5 million new solar-based connections by 2023 — highlights how difficult it is to scale renewable solutions quickly. \n    \n\n    \n            The program will expand energy access to 25 million individuals, delivering power to just 28% of Nigerians who don’t currently have access. And while a step in the right direction, solar panels on roofs are not necessarily adequate to power large industrial businesses, which require a great deal more electricity than what’s needed to switch on a light bulb or charge a cellphone.\n    \n\n    \n            Still, renewable technology is developing at lightning speed and this can only benefit Africa. \n    \n\n    \n            Mark Carrato, who coordinates the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Power Africa program, sees vast potential to deliver electricity to Africa in a climate smart way. \n    \n\n    \n            Since its launch in 2013, Power Africa has delivered electricity to over 118 million people on the continent, connecting 25 million homes and businesses to on and off-grid energy solutions. More than three quarters of the transactions it has closed are based on renewable technologies.\n    \n\n    \n            “In almost every case, project by project you see a renewables solution that is cheaper,” he told CNN Business.\n    \n\n    \n            Carrato argues that fossil fuels might provide short-term solutions to energy needs, but could end up taxing poorer countries in the long run through increased funding costs and the problem of “stranded assets,” in which infrastructure becomes obsolete as it is replaced by cleaner and cheaper renewable technologies.\n    \n\n    \n            “The cost of capital to do fossil fuels is only going to increase,” Carrato said.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            On the other hand, the cost of renewable technologies is rapidly declining.

The continent’s estimated potential to generate renewable energy from existing technologies is 1,000 times larger than its projected demand for electricity in 2040, according to IRENA.\n    \n\n    \n            “Renewable energy — including green hydrogen — could replace African exports of coal, oil and gas,” it said in a recent report with German development banks KfW and GIZ.\n    \n\n    \n            But to leverage the potential for renewables, average annual investments in Africa’s energy system must double by 2030 to approximately $65 billion.\n    \n\n    \n            While there’s good reason to be bullish on Africa’s potential to leapfrog fossil fuel technologies in favor of cleaner energy sources, the kind of renewable technology that can rapidly drive industrial development — to power factories, fuel transport and logistics networks and enable the digital economy to thrive — is not yet commercially available at scale. \n    \n\n    \n            In the meantime, some analysts argue that Africa needs reliable and affordable energy. “It’s absolutely untenable to hold the position that African countries and African people should wait until [battery] storage costs come down.

Energy for growth is energy needed in the wider economy used outside the home that can drive higher incomes but especially job creation.”\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            To put the world on track to reach net zero emissions by the middle of the century, the International Energy Agency estimates that annual clean energy investment into emerging and developing economies needs to increase more than sevenfold to $1 trillion annually by 2030.\n    \n\n    \n            As it stands, these economies currently account for just one fifth of global investment into clean energy and pay interest rates to borrow money that are up to seven times higher than in the United States or Europe. \n    \n\n    \n            Developed countries also remained $20 billion short of meeting a pledge to channel $100 billion per year by 2020 towards helping poor countries tackle climate change. \n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            “In many emerging and developing economies, emissions are heading upwards while clean energy investments are faltering, creating a dangerous fault line in global efforts to reach climate and sustainable energy goals,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a recent report.\n    \n\n    \n            “Countries are not starting on this journey from the same place — many do not have access to the funds they need to rapidly transition to a healthier and more prosperous energy future, and the damaging effects of the Covid-19 crisis are lasting longer in many parts of the developing world,” he added.\n    \n\n    \n            In the race to solve the climate crisis, there’s a clear risk that the development needs of poor countries are sacrificed in pursuit of global emissions goals. \n    \n\n    \n            Nigeria could be a testing ground.\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 15031, 'description': 'Africa’s biggest economy has 206 million people, endemic poverty and vast energy reserves that could be harnessed to fuel development.

Global neon consumption for chip production reached about 540 metric tons last year, Techcet estimates.\n    \n\n    \n            Both firms have shuttered their operations, according to company representatives contacted by Reuters, as Russian troops have escalated their attacks on cities throughout Ukraine, killing civilians and destroying key infrastructure.\n    \n\n    \n            The stoppage casts a cloud over the worldwide output of chips, already in short supply after the coronavirus pandemic drove up demand for cell phones, laptops and later cars, forcing some firms to scale back production.\n    \n\n    \n            While estimates vary widely about the amount of neon stocks chipmakers keep on hand, production could take a hit if the conflict drags on, according to Angelo Zino, an analyst at CFRA.\n    \n\n    \n            “If stockpiles are depleted by April and chipmakers don’t have orders locked up in other regions of the world, it likely means further constraints for the broader supply chain and inability to manufacture the end-product for many key customers,” he said.\n    \n\n    \n            Before the invasion, Ingas produced 15,000 to 20,000 cubic meters of neon per month for customers in Taiwan, Korea, China, the United States and Germany, with about 75% going to the chip industry, Nikolay Avdzhy, the company’s chief commercial officer, said in an email to Reuters.\n    \n\n    \n            The company is based in Mariupol, which has been under siege by Russian forces. On Wednesday, Russian forces destroyed a maternity hospital there, in what Kyiv and Western allies called a war crime. Moscow said the hospital was no longer functioning and had been occupied by Ukrainian fighters.\n    \n\n    \n            “Civilians are suffering,” Avdzhy said by email last Friday, noting that the company’s marketing officer could not respond because he had no internet or phone access.\n    \n\n    \n            Cryoin, which produced roughly 10,000 to 15,000 cubic meters of neon per month, and is located in Odessa, halted operations on Feb. 24 when the attacks began to keep employees safe, according to business development director Larissa Bondarenko.\n    \n\n    \n            Bondarenko said the company would be unable to fill orders for 13,000 cubic meter of neon in March unless the violence stopped. She said the company could weather at least three months with the plant closed, but warned that if equipment were damaged, that would prove a bigger drag on company finances and make it harder to restart operations quickly.\n    \n\n    \n            She also said she was unsure the company could access additional raw materials for making neon.\n    \n\n    \n            Taiwan’s Economy Ministry, in a statement to Reuters, said Taiwanese firms had already made advanced preparations and had “safety stocks” of neon, so it did not see any problems in the supply chain in the near term.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Taiwan’s central bank made similar comments earlier on Friday.\n    \n\n    \n            Ukrainian neon is a byproduct of Russian steel manufacturing.

Believed to have started in 2012, this underground trend exploded in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been on the rise ever since.\n    \n\n    \n            “We noticed a lot of our youths at the end of 2019 starting to use Amapiano music to create their food videos, their dance videos, their fashion videos, memes. And we really saw people embracing the genre and wanting to engage with it,” says Yuvir Pillay, music operations manager at TikTok South Africa.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            He says Amapiano is the country’s biggest musical genre on TikTok “We haven’t seen a local music genre take over a platform in this kind of huge escalation in a very long time,” he adds.\n    \n\n    \n            Now the sound is spreading beyond borders. In 2021, videos using the hashtag #Amapiano flexed their muscles on the popular app with more than 1.6 billion global views – while the “Amapiano Grooves” playlist on Spotify had more than 50 million streams worldwide.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            While its popularity is unquestioned, the birth of Amapiano – which means “the pianos” in South Africa’s Zulu language – is often the subject of debate. \n    \n\n    \n            The genre’s roots are disputed says AshMopedi, host of the Amapiano-dedicated YouTube channel Groove Cartel. “Perhaps it comes from the Gauteng region [northeastern province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria], where its origins can be traced, but as to who is that one person that created Amapiano, it’s a difficult thing,” he says. “Whoever it is, please come out and let us know.”\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    Amapiano: The new sound of South Africa\n                \n                    \n                                22:56\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n    \n            Some argue the infectious sound is rooted in Kwaito, a style of music which blended house beats with hip hop in the 1990s. Music producer,  record label owner, and Kwaito pioneer Oscar Sibonginkosi Mdlongwa, known as Oskido, says Kwaito emerged following a period of political change, that saw the release of Nelson Mandela and the decline of apartheid.\n    \n\n    \n            “The younger generation at that time, we started creating our own music, which we called Kwaito. We used to take house music, slow it down and from there, we reprogrammed the music,” he says.\n    \n\n    \n            Read more: The ‘anonymous’ South African artist turning dreams into reality through photography and AR\n    \n\n    \n            Fast forward two decades and Amapiano emerges. It features the same slowed-down house beats as Kwaito, but also incorporates jazz, synths and percussive basslines.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            DJs have since played a key role in popularizing the genre. Vigro Deep, a 20 year old Pretoria-born DJ, has taken the Amapiano scene by storm. His keen ear for music has helped catapult him to international success.\n    \n\n    \n            “I started producing by the age of 16, (when) Amapiano was something that was trending,” Vigro Deep says. \n    \n\n    \n            He says he takes pride in sharing the sound of the townships with the world – one that is innovative, collaborative and disruptive in the way it’s transforming an industry.\n    \n\n  In the Dark” – Vigro Deep ft.

It makes us who we are. It’s a sound where we can say, ‘this is us; this is South Africa, this is Africa.’” \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Although Amapiano started out as a genre dominated by male artists, more women are now stepping onto the scene – from DJ’ing and dancing to singing and even fashion design. \n    \n\n    \n            Part of the draw is what dancer Bontle Modiselle describes as an “inviting” style. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “When I think about Amapiano, I think about it being the perfect representation of what the Black South African youth today looks like and the fashion, what they feel like, what they sound like in their sounds, how they move in their dance moves,” she says.\n    \n\n    \n            Modiselle has amassed large followings on TikTok and Instagram, where she showcases Amapiano dances that pay homage to the past.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “The visual representation of Amapiano is such that it breeds from a ground of familiarity,” she says. “You’ll see a lot of Kwaito-esque movements that are reimagined in the look of Amapiano today.”\n    \n\n    \n            At the same time, that inviting style makes it accessible. “It just allows a culture where anyone, from anywhere, of any age can get together and do the same moves and feel like they’re a part of the same story,” she adds.\n    \n\n    \n            Yet success for women in Amapiano hasn’t come easily. \n    \n\n    \n            Mandisa Radebe, who goes by the stage name DBN Gogo, is one of the first female DJs to thrive in the genre. “(Initially) you didn’t see a lot of women DJs in the scene,” she says, adding that she found herself in the right place at the right time.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “Now you’re seeing a girl trend every single day and seeing this population of women in the industry grow by leaps and bounds,” she adds.\n    \n\n    \n            In 2021, Radebe’s hit song “Khuza Gogo” reached platinum status for exceeding 2.5 million streams, according to independent music distributors Electromode Ingrooves – cementing her reputation as a trailblazer for women in the genre.\n    \n\n  “Khuza Gogo” – DBN Gogo  feat.

Believed to have started in 2012, this underground trend exploded in popularity during the Covid-19 pandemic, and has been on the rise ever since.\n    \n\n    \n            “We noticed a lot of our youths at the end of 2019 starting to use Amapiano music to create their food videos, their dance videos, their fashion videos, memes. And we really saw people embracing the genre and wanting to engage with it,” says Yuvir Pillay, music operations manager at TikTok South Africa.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            He says Amapiano is the country’s biggest musical genre on TikTok “We haven’t seen a local music genre take over a platform in this kind of huge escalation in a very long time,” he adds.\n    \n\n    \n            Now the sound is spreading beyond borders. In 2021, videos using the hashtag #Amapiano flexed their muscles on the popular app with more than 1.6 billion global views – while the “Amapiano Grooves” playlist on Spotify had more than 50 million streams worldwide.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            While its popularity is unquestioned, the birth of Amapiano – which means “the pianos” in South Africa’s Zulu language – is often the subject of debate. \n    \n\n    \n            The genre’s roots are disputed says AshMopedi, host of the Amapiano-dedicated YouTube channel Groove Cartel. “Perhaps it comes from the Gauteng region [northeastern province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria], where its origins can be traced, but as to who is that one person that created Amapiano, it’s a difficult thing,” he says. “Whoever it is, please come out and let us know.”\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    Amapiano: The new sound of South Africa\n                \n                    \n                                22:56\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n    \n            Some argue the infectious sound is rooted in Kwaito, a style of music which blended house beats with hip hop in the 1990s. Music producer,  record label owner, and Kwaito pioneer Oscar Sibonginkosi Mdlongwa, known as Oskido, says Kwaito emerged following a period of political change, that saw the release of Nelson Mandela and the decline of apartheid.\n    \n\n    \n            “The younger generation at that time, we started creating our own music, which we called Kwaito. We used to take house music, slow it down and from there, we reprogrammed the music,” he says.\n    \n\n    \n            Read more: The ‘anonymous’ South African artist turning dreams into reality through photography and AR\n    \n\n    \n            Fast forward two decades and Amapiano emerges. It features the same slowed-down house beats as Kwaito, but also incorporates jazz, synths and percussive basslines.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            DJs have since played a key role in popularizing the genre. Vigro Deep, a 20 year old Pretoria-born DJ, has taken the Amapiano scene by storm. His keen ear for music has helped catapult him to international success.\n    \n\n    \n            “I started producing by the age of 16, (when) Amapiano was something that was trending,” Vigro Deep says. \n    \n\n    \n            He says he takes pride in sharing the sound of the townships with the world – one that is innovative, collaborative and disruptive in the way it’s transforming an industry.\n    \n\n  In the Dark” – Vigro Deep ft. DJ BucksPerformed by Vigro Deep and DJ BucksSource: Vigro Deep\n\n\n    \n            “I think people are now happy that we have our own genre,” he adds. “We started something from scratch. It makes us who we are. It’s a sound where we can say, ‘this is us; this is South Africa, this is Africa.’” \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Although Amapiano started out as a genre dominated by male artists, more women are now stepping onto the scene – from DJ’ing and dancing to singing and even fashion design. \n    \n\n    \n            Part of the draw is what dancer Bontle Modiselle describes as an “inviting” style. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “When I think about Amapiano, I think about it being the perfect representation of what the Black South African youth today looks like and the fashion, what they feel like, what they sound like in their sounds, how they move in their dance moves,” she says.\n    \n\n    \n            Modiselle has amassed large followings on TikTok and Instagram, where she showcases Amapiano dances that pay homage to the past.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            “The visual representation of Amapiano is such that it breeds from a ground of familiarity,” she says. “You’ll see a lot of Kwaito-esque movements that are reimagined in the look of Amapiano today.”\n    \n\n    \n            At the same time, that inviting style makes it accessible. “It just allows a culture where anyone, from anywhere, of any age can get together and do the same moves and feel like they’re a part of the same story,” she adds.\n    \n\n    \n            Yet success for women in Amapiano hasn’t come easily. \n    \n\n    \n            Mandisa Radebe, who goes by the stage name DBN Gogo, is one of the first female DJs to thrive in the genre. “(Initially) you didn’t see a lot of women DJs in the scene,” she says, adding that she found herself in the right place at the right time.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            “Now you’re seeing a girl trend every single day and seeing this population of women in the industry grow by leaps and bounds,” she adds.\n    \n\n    \n            In 2021, Radebe’s hit song “Khuza Gogo” reached platinum status for exceeding 2.5 million streams, according to independent music distributors Electromode Ingrooves – cementing her reputation as a trailblazer for women in the genre.\n    \n\n  “Khuza Gogo” – DBN Gogo  feat.

In 2021, Spotify’s flagship Amapiano playlist saw a streaming increase of 622% in South Africa alone, while the UK and US ranked second and third respectively with the most streams of that same playlist.\n    \n\n    \n            “In 20 years’ time, when we all look back at this period in time when we speak about the pandemic, Amapiano is going to be one of those things that comes up in conversation.” says YouTube host AshMopedi. “I feel that it’s one of those genres that just a mainstay, it’s not going to go anywhere.”\n    \n\n    \n            The genre is a “lifestyle,” adds Radebe, and though Amapiano is going global, it’s important to remember where it came from.\n    \n\n    \n            “It’s a culture. It’s a saving grace. It is a lifeline,” she says. “I think it’s really important that we don’t change the narrative, twist the narrative of the fact that this is a South African sound – that this is nurtured, it is built, it is grown here.” \n    \n\n                ', 'length': 8461, 'description': 'DJs such as Vigro Deep and DBN Gogo are bringing the deep house, log-drum driven basslines and soulful piano melodies of “Amapiano” to the world.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220214083045-amapiano-south-africa-dbn-gogo-music-club.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-02-15T06:28:20Z', 'keywords': ['africa', ' arts and entertainment', ' business and industry sectors', ' business', ' economy and trade', ' companies', ' continents and regions', ' dancers and dancing', ' demographic groups', ' females (demographic group)', ' media industry', ' music', ' music and dance', ' music industry', ' music releases', ' musical styles', ' population and demographics', ' society', ' south africa', ' southern africa', ' tiktok'], 'summary': ['“The younger generation at that time, we started creating our own music, which we called Kwaito.', 'We used to take house music, slow it down and from there, we reprogrammed the music,” he says.', 'Vigro Deep, a 20 year old Pretoria-born DJ, has taken the Amapiano scene by storm.', 'His keen ear for music has helped catapult him to international success.', '“I started producing by the age of 16, (when) Amapiano was something that was trending,” Vigro Deep says.', '“You’ll see a lot of Kwaito-esque movements that are reimagined in the look of Amapiano today.”', 'Yet success for women in Amapiano hasn’t come easily.', '“(Amapiano) has changed the way the record business works,” says Oskido.'], 'sentiment': {'score': 43, 'comparative': 0.034930950446791224, 'calculation': [{'important': 2}, {'grace': 1}, {'important': 2}, {'alone': -2}, {'increase': 1}, {'flagship': 2}, {'boost': 1}, {'big': 1}, {'success': 2}, {'certain': 1}, {'reached': 1}, {'success': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'accessible': 1}, {'inviting': 1}, {'pay': -1}, {'like': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'like': 2}, {'perfect': 3}, {'happy': 3}, {'disruptive': -2}, {'innovative': 2}, {'success': 2}, {'keen': 1}, {'dreams': 1}, {'infectious': -2}, {'please': 1}, {'difficult': -1}, {'disputed': -2}, {'popularity': 3}, {'popular': 3}, {'huge': 1}, {'kind': 2}, {'engage': 1}, {'rise': 1}, {'popularity': 3}], 'postive': ['important', 'grace', 'important', 'increase', 'flagship', 'boost', 'big', 'success', 'certain', 'reached', 'success', 'like', 'accessible', 'inviting', 'like', 'like', 'like', 'perfect', 'happy', 'innovative', 'success', 'keen', 'dreams', 'please', 'popularity', 'popular', 'huge', 'kind', 'engage', 'rise', 'popularity'], 'negative': ['alone', 'pay', 'disruptive', 'infectious', 'difficult', 'disputed']}}"

The deal will see Inkblot’s upcoming releases move onto Amazon’s platform after showing in cinemas. \n    \n\n    \n            “This allows us to plan long-term,” Onuzo says.

The local militia had left. The army came to the rescue for a matter of hours in the morning but then left before dusk, letting the attackers return the following night to burn the village down and most likely steal what gold it had. \n    \n\n    \n            In the end, somewhere between 170 and 200 people died, according to estimates by a local police source and other officials, and it still remains unclear who the killers were. \n    \n\n    \n            The massacre in Solhan, northern Burkina Faso, took place over two nights of extraordinary brutality in June 2021. The killings soon faded from international headlines, absorbed into the rhythms of persistent violence in the Sahel region, an arid stretch of land sandwiched by the Sahara Desert and the African savannah, and wracked by the climate emergency. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            In the lawless and remote communities of the Sahel, jihadists increasingly hold sway. Yet one likely culprit in this incident, al Qaeda’s local affiliate JNIM, condemned the attack’s brutality. And the other main suspect, ISIS, chose to blame it on al Qaeda, according to an ISIS-affiliated newspaper. \n    \n\n    \n            Dozens of interviews by CNN with survivors, local witnesses and Burkina Faso officials paint the most complete and disturbing narrative yet of a rampage perpetrated over 48 hours, partially by children, that the US-backed and trained Burkina Faso military was powerless to stop. \n    \n\n    \n            Yet few officials or witnesses agree on a coherent and consistent motive for the attack. Were the child attackers sent for Solhan’s gold, as currency for their Islamist masters? Was it a punishment killing ordered by jihadists against villagers loyal to the government? \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            The story of Solhan is a notable mark in the patina of brutality spreading across the Sahel. The intervention – and now ongoing drawdown – of the French military, the arrival of European Union forces, and the Pentagon’s sustained support mean billions have been spent in attempts to bolster the local security forces. Yet violence has spiraled instead, particularly in Burkina Faso over recent years. \n    \n\n    \n            The crisis in some of sub-Saharan Africa’s poorest states presents an imminent threat to Europe’s security, and by extension the United States, analysts say, in providing a secure and spacious breeding ground for terror networks. US officials have described the “wildfire of terrorism” in the Sahel, with al Qaeda and ISIS “on the march” in West Africa, aiming to “carve out a new caliphate.”\n    \n\n    \n            Illicit gold has emerged as a key source of funding for jihadist groups, who have been seizing so-called “informal mines” – small-scale mining sites which rely largely on physical labor and basic technology to extract precious metals and minerals – in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger since 2016, according to a Crisis Group report from 2019. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Bachir Ismael Ouédraogo, Burkina Faso’s minister of energy and mines, told CNN the country lost 20 tons of gold through informal mining and exports every year, worth roughly $1 billion on the open market. \n    \n\n    \n            Ouédraogo describes it as a “war economy,” a system that uses well-coordinated routes across the African continent. “The gold you end up buying is financing terrorism, and affecting our families here,” he added.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Trapped in the arid plains around 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of the capital Ouagadougou, Solhan’s gold is the village’s only asset, and its curse. \n    \n\n    \n            Satellite images of the village show the damage that informal mining has done to the terracotta soil – the charred grey tailings and spoil from the intense activity of men who spend so many hours digging underground that they must sleep outdoors to recover. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            A local government-backed militia called the VDP (a French acronym meaning Volunteers for the Defense of the Country) provides some security. Yet on the night of June 4, Solhan was left mostly defenseless.\n    \n\n    \n            More than 100 jihadists, on dozens of tricycles and motorbikes, had been spotted 20 kilometers (12 miles) from Solhan that afternoon, according to Boureima Ly, the emir of the local region of Yagha. \n    \n\n    \n            The army was warned of a possible attack, but it was unclear if it would target Solhan or nearby Sebba – according to Aly Bokoum, an activist with the Sahel Regional Youth Council in Burkina Faso – so the local unit chose to stay in Sebba, where it is based. The VDP in Solhan also contacted the army about the threat but were told to leave the village, according to Bokoum. \n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            CNN has made multiple attempts to contact Burkina Faso’s army for comment.\n    \n\n    \n            Gold appeared to set the attackers’ priorities. Mines at Mousiga, a tiny settlement to Solhan’s east, were hit first, according to a mining official and a miner who were present. Many of the survivors, witnesses and officials requested anonymity for their safety.\n    \n\n    \n            “Their faces were hidden with scarves,” the miner said of the assailants. “There were many of them on bikes and they started shooting. I started running for my life – for 30 kilometers, all night, to safety.” This miner said he did not see children among this group and two other officials denied the involvement of children at the Mousiga mines. \n    \n\n    \n            The distant gunfire from Mousiga was misinterpreted by the Solhan miners, who “thought it was the army coming” on a routine patrol and so “stayed next to their wells,” said the mining official. The attackers then hit a VDP base on the road into the village, before moving on to their main target.\n    \n\n    \n            On entering Solhan, the convoy of children, women and likely some men split. One group turned left towards the mines. Another drove calmly into the center of the village. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The first shots in Solhan, heard by witnesses at 2:08 a.m., were at the mines, the police source said. “The gold-diggers were first … ambushed … killed at random,” he said, while describing the typical night-time scene. “Most of the [miners] sleep outside, on site. They can’t sleep indoors, and they don’t go home either. Usually only a few of them get into the well late at night, and most come out because of the heat.”\n    \n\n    \n            One miner said some victims were shot dead as they slept outside and others were slaughtered as they worked, trapped underground. “All [the attackers] found outside were people sleeping,” he said. “That’s what made it possible for them to massacre them like that.” \n    \n\n    \n            Another miner said: “People started coming out of the pits and running … running for our lives.” He added that others hid inside the 30-foot-deep wells.\n    \n\n\n  \n\n    \n            The mining official described how a large gun was positioned beneath a nearby tree for use in the attack. “Many ran away, but when you run, you’re going to be seen and they shoot,” he said, adding that some miners survived by hiding in the pits until 8 a.m. “The first person who went down to the site [the following day] called me, and said the bodies were lying like fish,” the official said. \n    \n\n    \n            Several witnesses and officials told CNN that the attackers had in-depth knowledge of Solhan’s layout. “These are people who take the time to study their target,” confirmed the police source, who said witnesses mentioned distinctly hearing women’s voices among the attackers. “They indicated to ‘go to into this guy’s house, do this and that,’ and told children to ‘go here and there,’ that they couldn’t let one person leave,” the source said.\n    \n\n    \n            Local activist Abdou Hoeffi, from the human rights group Burkina Faso Movement for Human and People’s Rights (MBDHP), said the women played a cheerleading role with the child assailants, with shouts of: “You are a good shooter! You go!”\n    \n\n    \n            One witness, who said his parents were killed in the attack, told CNN in Solhan: “They came with women and little children holding guns. Francois, a shopkeeper, he was taken away, my friend. If it was a man, they killed him – a boy, they kidnapped him. A little one like that,” he said, gesturing the embrace of an infant in his arms, “who was breastfeeding [was taken away]. His mother lost her mind.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            One Solhan woman, her bright blue dress glistening as she sifted grains through a sieve, described surviving the night: “They destroyed everything … I fled into my house with my child on my back … I couldn’t sleep all night. We saw the light from the bullets all over the place … It was only God who saved us, otherwise they were going to exterminate us all.”\n    \n\n    \n            Another witness said he and his wife were in bed with their 5-day-old baby when they heard the gunfire. “Three terrorists passed by my house, in front of me, talking. They did not stop. I could see the bullets raining down everywhere in the night.” The witness, a former security guard for the local cellphone antenna, said the attackers disabled the phone mast that night and removed its battery, cutting the village off from the outside world and a chance of help.\n    \n\n    \n            The attackers left at dawn, and the same witness said that the villagers started to venture outside again by 5 a.m. “I couldn’t count the number of corpses that were on the side of the road,” he recalled. “Everywhere you go, there are bodies lying around.”\n    \n\n    \n            The mine was also an apocalyptic scene. “We found that everyone died at the well. I made up to eight trips with a motorcycle cab to carry corpses,” said another survivor.”  The mining official added that “everyone was loaded on and off the motorbikes like bags of grain.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Then the army finally arrived. One miner told CNN the attackers depended on the military’s slow reaction when launching their assault. “This is Burkina Faso. There is no fast response,” the miner said. “If they knew that in 30 or 40 minutes the army would come, they wouldn’t [attack]. But they took all their time.” \n    \n\n    \n            When the military did arrive, there was little to do but bury the dead, he said. “They dug a big hole. There was no other solution.” \n    \n\n    \n            The ex-phone antenna guard said the security forces asked villagers “to go back home and lock the door, and to not hide any terrorists.”\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Two officials said the militants’ convoy did not really leave at first light but instead relocated to a hideout in the brush, and waited. The mining official specified a remote border area where he believed they had hidden. The police source said it was not clear if they met leaders there for further instructions, or just waited for the cover of night.\n    \n\n    \n            Some of the villagers who remained in Solhan tried to flee, said the police source. “They didn’t know if it was over or not,” he said. The hospital in the nearest city, Dori, was “overwhelmed,” he said. But it was unclear if the attackers were finished with Solhan. At dusk, the answer came.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            “I heard the sound of their motorcycles and said, ‘Ah, they are [here] again,’” one witness said. “I went back to my yard, turned off the lights in my house, took my mat, took my blanket.” He said he left for another village – traveling on foot with a group of Solhan’s children, elderly residents and pregnant women. \n    \n\n    \n            But the convoy’s focus was different this time: They wanted to eradicate or loot all that remained. “They started to burn. They entered the houses,” said one survivor. “At the stores, they took clothes, drinks, money, put them in their vehicles.”\n    \n\n    \n            “They came back, they found four motorcycles at our place,” another survivor said. “They burned everything. They burned all our houses, until even the sheet metal was gone. They took rice, sugar, oil and boxes of other things.”\n    \n\n    \n            Showing a cameraman around what remained of his home, the survivor gestured to the devastation – the walls black with soot, apart from a patch where the TV was fixed before it too was looted. “The grenade went through the wall and went to the other side,” he said, pointing at a missing patch of plaster. “The whole roof is gone.”\n    \n\n    \n            The mining official said 80 sheep were also slaughtered in the violence. \n    \n\n    \n            Young men who survived the onslaught sought medication for the psychological trauma in nearby Dori, he added. “They were given pills or injections, because they say they couldn’t close their eyes, because they could still see the dead bodies.”\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            Video filmed in July shows the charred village clinic – the hospital beds and consultation room beyond use. Shops and homes were incinerated, and rows of buildings left collapsed or with only their metal gates remaining. Motorcycles were torched. Even the mining machinery used to break rocks was half-smashed, yet in the video some of it still hummed around the mines that remained functioning.   \n    \n\n    \n            Shell casings still lay on the ground. The scale of destruction – fueled, it seemed, by something more nihilistic than just looting – surprised some officials. \n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            Since June, officials, experts and survivors have been seeking to understand more about the massacre. \n    \n\n    \n            The government, facing protests in Dori over its inaction and security failings, blamed jihadists. \n    \n\n    \n            Government spokesperson Ousseni Tamboura told Radio France Internationale that two suspects had been detained before the attack and the arrests had led officials to link it to a little-known group called Mujahed al Qaeda, which is connected to the al Qaeda affiliate JNIM. Tamboura said gold was also a motivating factor. In the immediate aftermath, the government fired some security personnel and declared three days of national mourning.\n    \n\n    \n            Tamboura told CNN in November the government believes al Qaeda affiliate JNIM was behind the massacre. He put the death toll at 132, which includes attackers killed in the incident, and fatalities from a neighboring attack. \n    \n\n    \n            Tamboura declined to comment on the army’s absence in Solhan that night, and said that the Burkina Faso military followed all protocols set between them and the US as a condition for aid. The spokesman added that the jihadi groups were fueled by hunger to control resources, not by ideology.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            A French military intelligence official, who didn’t want to be named discussing sensitive information, agreed that jihadists were likely responsible, saying the massacre was likely committed by a group “in the process of being formed,” linked to JNIM. The official said attacks against the general population, as indiscriminate as those on Solhan, were more the hallmark of ISIS, however.\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            The display of violence has once again highlighted the rapid deterioration of social structures and security in the Sahel region. \n    \n\n    \n            A US intelligence official said: “There is absolutely a continued need for Western involvement and engagement to address the expansion of the al Qaeda- and ISIS-based groups in the area and not give them complete freedom of movement – as well as to build [the] capability [and] capacity of African partners.”\n    \n\n    \n            The US official added that the crisis seemed to be fueled by local partnerships between jihadists and not an influx of ISIS fighters from the collapse of the former ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They said that they have not noticed a broad trend of ISIS fighters moving from the Middle East to the Sahel area, with the exception of one or two persons of interest. \n    \n\n    \n            The official said the main concern was how ISIS affiliates across Africa were able to share tactics and build each other’s capabilities. \n    \n\n    \n            “Whether it’s physical facilitation capabilities from a group like ISIS Somalia with more skilled fighters [or] better media coordination from other groups, and being able to rapidly disseminate those capabilities more widely … it is hugely concerning,” they explained. “You could take a group that is probably not very effective and make them very effective quickly, if they’re able to leverage some of that skill set.”\n    \n\n    \n            In Burkina Faso and its Sahel neighbors Mali and Niger, armed Islamist groups have killed more than 800 civilians in attacks during 2021 alone, according to Human Rights Watch.  \n    \n\n    \n            Three days of mourning was declared in Burkina Faso after an August attack in the village of Gorgadji, about 50 kilometers west of Dori, where militants killed 80 people, reported Agence France-Presse. \n    \n\n    \n            Fourteen soldiers were reportedly ambushed and killed in October near Yirgou, also in the north, the site of a similar attack that killed 15 police in June, according to Reuters. \n    \n\n    \n            Gunmen killed dozens of people in another massacre in Yirgou in 2019, according to Amnesty International.\n    \n\n\n       \n    \n\n\n    \n            This rise in violence has occurred despite the US’s enduring, low-profile military mission in Burkina Faso, which pumped in tens of millions of dollars in aid during 2018-19.\n    \n\n    \n            Dozens of advisers are reported to mentor elements of the country’s military, while a US embassy factsheet said the US has trained and equipped 3,000 soldiers and gendarmes. \n    \n\n    \n            Yet significant swathes of Burkina Faso’s volatile north remain outside of the government’s control. Long-running accusations of abuses by the military have also complicated its relationship with its key military backers, specifically France and the US.\n    \n\n    \n            Human rights organizations also face difficulties in Burkina Faso. The government suspended the operations of the Norwegian Refugee Council in September after the humanitarian group noted the country’s speed at registering displaced people.  \n    \n\n    \n            For the police source, however, the massacre at Solhan was particularly methodical and unparalleled in its brutality. “These are people who take the time to study their target,” he said. “It is painful to see a woman instructing a child to kill such and such. Painful.”\n    \n\n    \n            And for the survivors, the initial absence of the army, as well as its departure as night fell, are indications of the dark place they live in. \n    \n\n    \n            “If the [army] are not with the people, how is that possible?,” one survivor said. “As soon as the army left, [the attackers] came again. This is a strange country. It’s a strange country.”\n    \n\n                ', 'length': 19666, 'description': 'The men were shot as they slept outside, having spent their days underground, choking in the Sahel dust, digging

For many, that’s the moment when we hope we can get back to our regular lives.   \n    \n\n    \n            Several times during this pandemic, I have written essays about America as if the country was my patient. The current situation has me thinking along those lines again.  \n    \n\n    \n            Doctors, like anyone else, love to give good news. We see the value of hope but also recognize that honesty must be our North Star. I would love to be the good guy here and tell my patient that it’s time to be discharged from this chapter of our lives. But a doctor’s job is to fully assess the situation and lean into the nuance, as opposed to simple axioms. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            So let’s examine America, the patient. On the one hand, the numbers are going down. Cases of Covid-19 are more than a third lower this week than they were last week and the lowest they’ve been since July, according to the latest data from Johns Hopkins University.  And the number of people hospitalized is about a fifth of what it was during the country’s mid-January peak. Even deaths, the so-called lagging indicator, have been falling; they’re at their lowest point in two months. \n    \n\n    \n            All 50 states are in the process of lifting restrictions. On March 26, Hawaii will become the last state to end its indoor mask mandate. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            At the federal level, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention made big changes in late February. Instead of primarily using  levels of coronavirus transmission within a community as the key metric for determining mask guidance, the agency recommends that three data points be considered instead: new Covid-19 hospitalizations, hospital capacity and Covid-19 cases. \n    \n\n    \n            So now, instead of a transmission map that paints most of the country an “inflamed” red, the community levels map shows a lot of cooler green and yellow, with a bit of orange – the new low, medium and high categories. Since that change, there has been a big drop in the percentage of Americans living under masking recommendations, from 99% under the old metrics to just about 2% now.\n    \n\n    \n            And at the start of the month, the White House unveiled its National Covid-19 Preparedness Plan. The new plan focuses on “vaccines, treatments, tests, masks,” White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said. “These tools are how we continue to protect people and enable us to move forward safely and get back to our more normal routines.”\n    \n\n    \n            As part of that, government testing and treatment initiatives are being streamlined and made more widely available.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            But in medicine, we cannot rely on lab results and a medical history. We need to perform a thorough and detailed exam. And when we do that, a more complete picture of the patient emerges.  \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Truth is, America, my patient still has an active infection. Although the numbers are falling, they are still painfully high: The country is averaging just under 37,000 new cases of Covid-19 a day. It’s as if saying the patient used to have a very high fever but now only has a moderately high fever. The point is, it’s still too high. We wouldn’t stop treating the patient’s infection at this point but rather complete the course of treatment and care.\n    \n\n    \n            There’s also the issue of understanding the effects the illness may have on my patient in the future. In this case, it means acknowledging an entirely new disease: long Covid. \n    \n\n    \n            Many Americans are enduring the lingering effects of a past infection, battling health conditions like fatigue, brain fog, shortness of breath, cardiac issues. The list of long Covid symptoms is lengthy and varied; there are no answers as to who and why, nor are there easy, one-size-fits-all treatments. \n    \n\n    \n            We are in the early days of this disease, but I was particularly struck by the recent paper indicating a previous Covid infection being a significant risk factor for future heart problems.\n    \n\n    \n            And, even more important, there are still about 30,000 Americans hospitalized for Covid and, on average, more than 1,250 deaths a day. That’s the equivalent of about two jumbo jets dropping out of the sky every day. \n    \n\n    \n            My patient still needs lots of care.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Despite the less red and inflamed transmission map, it still shows there’s a lot of virus out there. If the virus came in the form of a raindrop, parts of our country would still be getting drenched. \n    \n\n    \n            I have often imagined how different things would be if we could have actually seen the virus – little green particles circulating around people’s noses and mouths and becoming airborne. What if we had been able to witness its destruction and journey into blood vessels and lungs? This invisible enemy circumvented our basic human ability to detect a threat and, as a result, made us more likely to ignore and even deny it. \n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            I would remind my patient we have been here before. We experienced moments of genuine hope earlier and then witnessed how quickly things can change. In the summer of 2021, the Delta variant surprised us, and in December, Omicron blindsided us. Both times, the spikes caused by these variants followed declarations of victory heralding the end of the pandemic. \n    \n\n    \n            Currently, there is a subvariant of Omicron called BA.2 that may spread even faster than Omicron itself. According to the latest figures from the CDC, it now makes up about 11.6% of Covid cases in the US; the week before, 6.6%. BA.2 is the dominant variant in Denmark, the United Kingdom, India, South Africa and more than a dozen other countries. According to the World Health Organization, studies estimate it is 30% more contagious than the original Omicron (BA.1).  \n    \n\n    \n            And while studies suggest that BA.2 is not more likely to lead to hospitalization than BA.1, another patient that I’ve been keeping an eye on, the United Kingdom, is seeing cases and hospitalizations starting to trend up again after declining steadily since mid-January. Sometimes, doctors gain a lot of information from watching how other patients are faring.\n    \n\n  \n\n       \n    \n\n    \n            Again, I get it. I would love to look at these past two years in the rearview mirror as well, but we need to learn the lessons of this pandemic and apply that knowledge in real time. Today. Now.\n    \n\n    \n            Delta and Omicron represent two cautionary tales in the span of a few months. It would be shortsighted to ignore that reality, believing it will never happen again.  \n    \n\n  \n    A blend of science and judgment \n\n\n    \n            The International Epidemiology Association’s Dictionary of Epidemiology defines a pandemic as “an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people.”  \n    \n\n    \n            Two years ago, when we made the decision to use the word pandemic on CNN, before the CDC or WHO, it was fairly straightforward – fundamentally, it was an exercise in math and data analysis. My producers and I spent a lot of time looking at whiteboards where we kept tabs on the growing numbers and locations of Covid-19 cases. One day, I remember thinking, “If this isn’t the very definition of a pandemic, I don’t know what is. So why is no one else calling it that?”  \n    \n\n    \n            And so we did.\n    \n\n\n    \n    \n\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n       \n    \n\n                    \n                \n                    Dr. Gupta: Here's why CNN is calling this a pandemic (2020)\n                \n                    \n                                04:40\n                            \n                             - Source:\n                CNN\n    \n                    \n                \n\n\n    \n            Although the line was clear entering the pandemic, it will be much fuzzier as we approach endemicity.  A disease is considered endemic when it is a “constant presence … within a given geographic area or population group.” It would also be predictable in its rate of spread without causing the level of disruption it does in a pandemic. \n    \n\n    \n            But what is considered disruptive may be very different in one country compared with another, even from one person to the next. Progressing into this next phase will be based on a blend of science and judgment. \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            So if America were my patient, the question I would be asking: Is it really time to downgrade the country’s present-day condition from pandemic to endemic? \n    \n\n    \n            It’s analogous in some ways to deciding when to discharge my surgical patients to the general care floor from the intensive care unit. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            I make rounds in the intensive care unit, carefully reviewing each patient’s chart – full of lab results, metrics and data. And then I sit at the bedside, watching, examining and understanding how they really feel. Can they stand on their own, put a fork to their mouth and a comb through their hair? Are their basic bodily functions returning to normal, and can they get by independently? It is a judgment call. Two people can have the same vital signs but be in very different places.     \n    \n\n    \n            If America were my patient, what would I see when I sit at its bedside? Beyond 1,300 people dying a day, I would make note that almost 60,000 people died of Covid-19 during the month of February alone. In other words, more people died of Covid-19 in one month than die of the flu during a bad year.  \n    \n\n    \n             So the question ultimately is: What is too disruptive? What are we willing to tolerate? At what point do we as a society throw up our hands and say, “We can’t do any better than this,” so let’s call this level of sickness and death “endemic,” accept the numbers and move on with our lives? \n    \n\n    \n            And of course, my patient, America, lives on a planet with lots of other patients, all part of an intricate ecosystem. We must realize that America’s health is dependent on the health of all the other patients on the planet: When any one of us is at risk, we are all at risk. \n    \n\n  \n    Finding a measure of peace and quiescence \n\n\n    \n            None of this is easy. It’s why epidemiologist and author Dr. Larry Brilliant said that “endemic” is a terrible word.  \n    \n\n    \n            “Smallpox was ‘endemic’ when it killed somewhere between a third and half a billion people in the 20th century. Malaria is endemic, and it’s killing millions. Tuberculosis is endemic. And HIV/AIDS was sort of thrown out of people’s consciousness by just labeling it ‘endemic,’ ” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            Brilliant, who is CEO of Pandefense Advisory and\u202fa senior adviser at the Skoll Foundation, was a key player on the WHO team that eradicated smallpox.     \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            He pointed out that the technical definition of “endemic” is a disease that is generating an expected number of cases, to the expected community and the expected time. “And because [Covid-19] is a baby of a disease … it’s way too early to try to figure out what is endemicity. We have to wait for it to become a teenager and see how it behaves,” he said.  \n    \n\n    \n            Brilliant prefers the term “quiescent.” “We want this thing to be quiet,” he said. \n    \n\n    \n            He recalled that in the early days of 2020, he and other epidemiologists and public health experts speculated that the illness would come in waves.  \n    \n\n    \n            “A wave is a really good metaphor to think about this. Sometimes, the waves come in a bunch at a time, and sometimes there’s not a wave for hours, even days. Some waves are too small to really be called waves. But every once in a while, there’s a rogue wave, this tsunami.” \n    \n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            He explained, “what we want is the interval [between waves] to be long and the water in the waves to be quiescent. And that’s what we’re trying to say when people use the word ‘endemic.’ … To say that the pandemic has gone endemic is failure – it’s not success. We haven’t put it where we want it. So it’s the wrong way of thinking about it.” \n    \n\n    \n            Plus, said Brilliant, saying that the pandemic is over means “we give up our duty of care.”\n    \n\n    \n            He believes we still have a duty of care to the immunocompromised, the elderly, the vulnerable and, yes, even the unvaccinated, because they are the ones disproportionately dying.  \n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Humans are increasingly living side by side with pathogens that were once in the wild but then took hold among us. We might not like it, and sometimes the pathogen comes too close for comfort, but we learn to live with it.  \n    \n\n    \n            Take the parasite malaria. For millennia, it killed off wide swaths of the global population. In fact, the mosquito, which transmits the parasite that causes disease, is one of the most prolific killers of humans worldwide. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            Inarguably, the course of humanity has been shaped by malaria: It’s believed to have contributed to the fall of Rome, and for hundreds of years, it helped protect Africa from European colonization even as it infected the local population. (And it’s why the gene for sickle cell anemia, which is protective against malaria, never died off evolutionarily.) In this country, Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln grappled with it. The disease stunted the physical and economic growth of the rural South through the 1930s, and it is why the precursor to the CDC was founded.   \n    \n\n    \n            It’s an understatement to say man has been living with malaria for a very long time. And although we may not have eradicated it from the face of the Earth or completely tamed it, we have learned to coexist with it and reduced it to an endemic disease in a shrinking number of countries. The United States eradicated it in 1951.   \n    \n\n    \n            How did we do that? By arming ourselves with knowledge. Through scientific research, we learned about where malaria comes from and how it is spread. We developed mitigation strategies and medications to blunt its impact.  \n    \n\n    \n            And our work is still not done: In 2020, malaria killed an estimated 627,000 people, the vast majority of them children in sub-Saharan Africa.\n    \n\n  \n\n    \n            Many experts, including Brilliant, are pretty sure that Covid-19 is here to stay. Like the common cold (also often caused by a coronavirus) or the flu, it’s expected to be part of our lives for the next 10, 50 or 100 years, and life will never be quite the same again. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n            But we can improve the situation and learn to live with it. \n    \n\n    \n            “We want the disease to occur in places that we expect it, in the numbers that we expect, so we know how to deal with it,” Brilliant said. “You can go to Hawaii on vacation and not worry. Your kids can go to school. And you don’t need to worry about going to dinner with your parents or your grandparents. Maybe it’s quiet and you have to still wear masks. Maybe it’s quiet and you still have to be tested before you go someplace. But it’s not on the front page every day.” \n    \n\n    \n            The key, said Brilliant, is two-part: early detection and rapid response.  \n    \n\n    \n            For that to happen, we have to have good monitoring tools and be nimble going into and out of protective mode. Maybe that means we carry a mask in our coat pocket during wintertime, just like we take an umbrella when the forecast predicts rain; maybe we keep a box of rapid tests and a packet of antivirals in the bathroom cabinet for when we are under the weather; maybe we close a school but like we do with the flu – with surgical precision, using a scalpel instead of a chainsaw.\n    \n\n    \n            The good news, Brilliant said, is that moving forward, our tools – vaccines, surveillance, tests, treatments, prophylactics – will only get better. \n    \n\n    \n            The inescapable fact is that we live in the era of pandemics. There are simply more and more opportunities for a pathogen, like the SARS-CoV-2 virus, to come in contact with the human population, make the jump and take hold. It’s a dance we are increasingly doing because we are infringing more and more on the microbes’ territory. Population growth, deforestation, climate change all contribute to this. \n    \n\n  \n\n\n    \n            These pathogens are going to keep emerging in humans, but pandemics are not inevitable. Humans have evolved to create remarkable public health tools to prevent that, just as long we are smart and humane enough to use them.  \n    \n\n    \n            My patient – America – is still in precarious health and will have to be careful moving forward to maintain all of the gains and continue making progress. Both the patient and doctors will have to remain vigilant and act quickly if there’s any new infection. \n    \n\n    \n            It’s just not time for my patient to completely drop their guard, however much we would all like that to happen. We can and should be hopeful, but honesty must lead the way, full and transparent. \n    \n\n  \n  CNN’s Andrea Kane contributed to this report.\n\n\n                "", 'length': 17828, 'description': 'As we reach the second anniversary of the World Health Organization acknowledging Covid-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, we appear to be standing on the edge of the endemic phase of this global health crisis.

The spokesperson affirmed that the restrictions on calls for assassination apply globally. \n    \n\n    \n            Meta’s earlier decision allows Ukrainian users to post otherwise prohibited calls for violent self-defense or condemnation of Russia’s invasion, and effectively created more leeway for users in the country to express support for violence on Meta’s platforms. (On Sunday, Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine’s Minister of Digital Transformation thanked Meta and said the decision “respect[ed] our right to counter the aggression” from Russia.)\n    \n\n    \n            But Meta was forced to clarify its stance after Russia accused it of facilitating “illegal calls for murder and violence” against Russian citizens and opened a criminal case against the company. Russia has separately moved to block Facebook and Instagram in the country as part of a crackdown on information about the war in Ukraine, though a growing number of Russian internet users appear determined to circumvent the ban.  \n    \n\n    \n            The Ukraine-specific policy on hate speech, which is temporary, is “focused on protecting people’s rights to speech as an expression of self-defense in reaction to a military invasion of their country,” Clegg said in a public statement Friday. The statement added that Meta has “no quarrel with the Russian people” and that “there is no change at all in our policies on hate speech as far as the Russian people are concerned.”\n    \n\n    \n            Clegg’s internal post on Sunday doubled down on that position.\n    \n\n    \n            “We are now narrowing the focus to make it explicitly clear in the guidance that it is never to be interpreted as condoning violence against Russians in general,” Clegg wrote, adding that the hate-speech carveout for Ukraine applies only to speech “regarding the Russian military invasion.”\n    \n\n                \n    \n  \n\n\n\n          \n        \n          \n    \n        \n      \n        CNN Business Videos\n      \n\n    \n\n\n      \n      \n    "", 'length': 11596, 'description': 'Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, issued a reminder on Sunday that it prohibits calls on its platforms for the assassination of high-ranking world leaders, following intense scrutiny of the company’s decision last week to relax hate speech policies in Ukraine.', 'siteName': 'CNN', 'topImage': 'https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220314100910-02-facebook-app-stock.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill', 'date': '2022-03-14T16:20:37Z', 'keywords': ['continents and regions', ' eastern europe', ' europe', ' government and public administration', ' government bodies and offices', ' heads of government', ' heads of state', ' nick clegg', ' political figures - intl', ' politics', ' russia', ' death and dying', ' society', ' assassinations', ' discrimination', ' russia-ukraine conflict', ' societal issues', ' ukraine', ' unrest', ' conflicts and war'], 'summary': [""Something isn't loading properly."", 'Please check back later.', ""See what's inside 00:57 Now playing - Source: CNN Business This teen died by suicide."", 'Clegg’s internal post on Sunday doubled down on that position.', 'CNN Business Videos'], 'sentiment': {'score': -52, 'comparative': -0.07647058823529412, 'calculation': [{'invasion': -1}, {'violence': -3}, {'clear': 1}, {'concerned': -2}, {'hate': -3}, {'no': -1}, {'invasion': -1}, {'hate': -3}, {'ban': -2}, {'determined': 2}, {'growing': 1}, {'war': -2}, {'block': -1}, {'criminal': -3}, {'murder': -2}, {'accused': -2}, {'forced': -1}, {'violence': -3}, {'support': 2}, {'effectively': 2}, {'invasion': -1}, {'condemnation': -2}, {'violent': -3}, {'assassination': -3}, {'hate': -3}, {'intense': 1}, {'assassination': -3}, {'prohibits': -1}, {'promoted': 1}, {'misinformation': -2}, {'stop': -1}, {'struggling': -2}, {'no': -1}, {'like': 2}, {'tension': -1}, {'fake': -3}, {'suing': -2}, {'suicide': -2}, {'died': -3}, {'misinformation': -2}, {'struggles': -2}, {'restore': 1}, {'restore': 1}, {'please': 1}], 'postive': ['clear', 'determined', 'growing', 'support', 'effectively', 'intense', 'promoted', 'like', 'restore', 'restore', 'please'], 'negative': ['invasion', 'violence', 'concerned', 'hate', 'no', 'invasion', 'hate', 'ban', 'war', 'block', 'criminal', 'murder', 'accused', 'forced', 'violence', 'invasion', 'condemnation', 'violent', 'assassination', 'hate', 'assassination', 'prohibits', 'misinformation', 'stop', 'struggling', 'no', 'tension', 'fake', 'suing', 'suicide', 'died', 'misinformation', 'struggles']}}"
